        Q: (J) He&#39;s doing their work but he is not on their payroll. (T) He is doing as good a job as they are putting out the disinformation. (L) Earlier we had a discussion about where we wanted to move. My husband has his ideas, we all have our ideas, and we just want to know, in terms of just being happy and content with the surroundings, of the places mentioned: South Dakota, North Carolina, which would be more pleasant?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: As we have told you before, moving is pointless, as it is a manifestation of 3rd density thinking, and would thus regress you severely. It is not &#34;where you are that matters, it is who and or what you are that counts.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) That is not the point that we were talking about. We were not talking about moving out of fear. We were talking about moving out of the simple desire to not live in this area any longer because we don&#39;t like it! I want to get out of the heat!

      <p class="answer">
        A: That is 3rd density in the extreme!!!

        A: Then do it, but don&#39;t expect us to be there!
      </p>
      <p>
        {At the time, I felt that this was a strong influence from Frank who was very much against anyone making any changes at all, let alone moving.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Since Terry and Jan have the urge to acquire larger space for themselves, what would you propose they do if not move to North Carolina?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Does larger space automatically equate long distance move?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) No, it doesn&#39;t, but I don&#39;t want to spend the kind of money required to get a larger house in St. Petersburg. This is something we have talked about for a long time.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Is St. Petersburg your only option?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) We don&#39;t know, we have to find that out. It depends on what happens with jobs and other things. (L) Is my financial situation blocked because of my plans and ideas about moving?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) Well, that is what we are trying to do, and one of the possibilities is moving to North Carolina. (L) Okay, I say that I don&#39;t know what the Universe wants me to do. I am just waiting to see, and waiting for direction. What more can I do?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Good!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) That&#39;s what we are doing. We are trying to open our minds up to all the possibilities. Something may open up here, or in St. Pete, or somewhere else. We don&#39;t know. And, unless we open all the doors to find the one that&#39;s right. We have to shake all the bushes.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: As long as you wish to communicate with us, and learn from the information we are sharing with you, multitudes of possibilities will present themselves to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this mean even for my husband, that he will get a good job? Is his potential also connected to this communication?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If a &#34;good job&#34; is what he desires, yes, however, if others are trying to convince him that that is what he desires, then there will continue to be blocking of the &#34;flow&#34; taking place! L___ is of the utmost importance to us!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Why do I keep having dreams of him abandoning me and the kids when the UFOs start landing?

        A: Discover.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) That&#39;s your fear. (L) Okay, you say he is of the utmost importance. Could you give us a clue about that, please?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: All are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, he would like to have some advice as to how to shape his life from this point on?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Do what you really want to, and all else will fall into place, but don&#39;t procrastinate or &#34;dream your life away.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, have we pretty much exhausted this subject and should we move onto something else here?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) I think we have pretty much exhausted the subject. We don&#39;t know what is going to happen and we are just waiting to see what the Universe has to offer.
      </p>
