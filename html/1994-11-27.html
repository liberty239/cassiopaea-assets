      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Hello.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Hello. Illo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Your name is Illo? Who are you and where are you from?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Cassiopaea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I have a few little questions I want to ask, and I know they are personal and I know how you feel about personal questions but there is a reason for the importance of these questions. The first is why is it every time I think about sitting at the board my left ear starts doing strange things?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: DNA responding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (LM) Why or how would DNA make your ear hurt?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Changes.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) My husband is really concerned about his truck. This may sound like a simple thing, but for us it is because we can&#39;t just go and spend money on fixing it only to find out that is the wrong thing and something else needs fixing. We need to know what is wrong with it so that we can fix it with the least amount of expenditure.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Catalytic converter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (LM) It doesn&#39;t have one. (L) He doesn&#39;t have one. What is wrong with the truck?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Space where converter should be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (LM) Whoever is telling you this is abysmally mechanically ignorant. No 1978 truck ever had a catalytic converter.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Check it. Your assertion. Fuel line clogged at bottom where &#34;cc&#34; should be. {This proved to be absolutely correct! A rubber cap was missing which led to the obstruction and LM was amazed.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it possible to do hypnotic future progressions that give accurate information in a general sense?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In the book &#34;Mass Dreams of The Future&#34;, are these statistically analyzed mass dreams in any way accurate?

      <p class="answer">
        A: In a sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it possible, since they showed several different scenarios... why am I feeling so strange at this moment?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Anemic/low blood sugar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So it is not an emotional reaction to my husband&#39;s hostility? {LM had left the room.}

        Q: (L) Well, you don&#39;t seem to be really in tune or accurate about what is going on here tonight. {I was assuming that the response about the truck was wrong.}

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, last night you said you affected our psyches in order to have us make changes on the board. It occurred to me that you might have the ability to change the electromagnetics of the body which would then affect the physical body, is this correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, could you perform an electromagnetic healing on me, that is, on the etheric or spirit body, which would then manifest in the physical body?

        A: Do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) You do? Well, I would like to have more of it, more often. I would like you to speed up the process because I am fairly miserable in the physical sense. Is that possible?

        A: Cycle will pass.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, let&#39;s go back to the truck. Do you think you can tap into anybody who is a mechanic and just give us...
