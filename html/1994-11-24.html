        Q: (L) Hello.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Greetings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who do we have with us tonight?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Peehmi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Have you ever lived on earth?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. There is little need to ask question each time as this is now grooved channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does that mean that the vibrations have been adjusted for you specifically and that others cannot utilize it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Cannot unless you request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are you aware of the letter I got today from Karla Turner?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We are Cassiopaean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does that mean that you are aware?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We are aware of your entire life aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What caused her to react to the channelled information the way she did. Obviously something upset her, what was it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Miffed by personal references; suspicious of motives send her this session verbatim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, okay, what would you say to her... obviously she thinks you, as a source, were caught in a lie and that put her off, what can you say in response to that accusation, I guess you would call it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: There are no lies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, obviously that is something that can be said, but she thinks that since you did not come right out and describe everything in precise detail about those two little boys in South Carolina, that what little you did say, she interpreted as a lie. What else is going on here that...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: There are no lies only interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it important for her to receive information from this source?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: It is important for all on planet to learn at their own pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is Karla&#39;s pace slower?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Apples and Oranges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I would like to address the issue of accuracy. How can we increase or determine or work on accuracy?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Accuracy is 3rd level concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, you do understand that at this level we determine whether information is correct or good by whether it happens or comes true, particularly in terms of prognostications.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And if a source misses on a prognostication, very often people lose faith in that source. Is that an unrealistic expectation?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is that because accuracy is an impossible task because of variability of reality?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If it were possible there would be no existence. The universe is nothing more than a learning laboratory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, well, at this point I am wondering if there is any point in writing to Karla and sharing our information with her at all?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Of course. You are all learning. Share information to learn more faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there anything that can be said to her to help her in a positive way?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Have empathy. She was raised to put others before herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, okay, tell us about this, with the existing probabilities, will Terry and Jan be with us this coming Saturday?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes. But up to you. Ask and you shall receive.

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Some, because of your sex references.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) He is mad because I identified his motivations toward S__ as being sexually inspired? Was this true?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes. But truth hurts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Can you tell us about this recent volcanic eruption? What was the cause?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: All waves in nature have a &#34;contract&#34; phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does that mean like just before a wave comes up on shore it kind of sucks everything out?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) When I had the dream about doing battle with the dragon, was that just a dream, an astral event, or an actual interaction with the Lizzies?
      </p>

      <p>
        Q: (L) So we just have to stay on our toes at all times?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Absolutely don&#39;t let others distract you. You have suffered many attempts at distraction away from truth. Now follow some proclamations: Pause. All there is is lessons. This is one infinite school. There is no other reason for anything to exist. Even inanimate matter learns it is all an &#34;Illusion.&#34; Each individual possesses all of creation within their minds. Now, contemplate for a moment. Each soul is all powerful and can create or destroy all existence if know how. You and us and all others are interconnected by our mutual possession of all there is. You may create alternative universes if you wish and dwell within. You are all a duplicate of the universe within which you dwell. Your mind represents all that exists. It is &#34;fun&#34; to see how much you can access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) It&#39;s fun for who to see how much we can access?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Where?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We asked you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I guess there is no limit.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If there is no limit, then what is the difference between your own mind and everything else?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I guess there is no difference if all is ultimately one.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Right. And when two things each have absolutely no limits, they are precisely the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is this all you are going to give for tonight?

        A: Yes. But more complex than that will explain further another session.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes. But where are you going to get all the hardware?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I didn&#39;t say I was going to do it, I just wanted to know if you could tell us how.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there anything in a few words that you want to tell us before we end tonight?
