        Q: Jan wants to know about the trip she and Terry made to New York...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Wrong mental approach for trip in preparatory phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) What phase do you mean? We went too soon?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: And ideas &#34;askew.&#34; Why did you look upon it as a business trip? You were so uptight and argumentative!! Want to tear this marriage apart?!? Then try another one of those.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: How can Jan stop being so uptight?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

        A: Then why ask the question?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) That wasn&#39;t the answer I was expecting. We were trying to figure out why Terry&#39;s Aunt acted the way she did...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Vibrations affect all concerned. Next trip... we suggest pleasure only. Have you noticed how all your trips are for business? Unleash the pursestrings for fun and stop worrying about money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Should Jan call Tracy?
      </p>

        Q: (L) Okay, {Ark&#39;s}e divorce: the judge has refused to change the hearing date so that it is before he leaves... his idea is that we should wait for this hearing since it is only 9 days and something may be accomplished.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Stumbling blocks await.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: In other words, stumbling blocks if he waits for the hearing?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Your best bet is to concentrate upon the developments of Arkadiusz&#39;s career and not expend so much energy on a situation designed to destroy your work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Anything else you want me to tell him about the divorce or the hearing or anything?
      </p>

      <p>
        Q: Do it!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You know, my dear, there are legal and other powers in this country which can supercede the &#34;corruption and shenanigans&#34; taking place in Poland involving this case. All one needs to do is to mine and trawl for same, then utilize properly. The one mistake Arkadiusz is still making is that he is still too trusting of the system to which he is most familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Is there some further - if he stays for this hearing will something happen that will cause him to have to stay longer?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Well, it is not so much that &#34;something will happen,&#34; as that the merry-go-round will just turn and turn...
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Perhaps he should suggest that he can oversee a student exchange program and use this as leverage to get them to cooperate with him...

        Q: Fernando?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

        Q: When I read the article by Rupert Cornwell and there was a paragraph that was identical to what I had written on the original web-page, and then he made the remark about the circle of daggers surrounding Prince Charles, that he was in the center of a circle of sharp daggers... that struck me as a rather bizarre thing to say. With all the theories going around about the various families and bloodlines killing each other off from time to time... and this is connected with all this other underground business, CIA, KGB, God knows what else... Is the way the press plays the event a capitalizing on a circumstance on behalf of such conspiratorial groups?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If so, that is nothing new.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Was this Cornwell saying in this article that the &#34;dagger men&#34; are gathered around Charles and that they are going to use this event to bring him down?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Were the deaths, in addition to generating feelings of STO, also to speed up the process of the changing of the systems, the entering the new realms...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: There is still something we are not getting. And, they are waiting for me to figure it out - okay. But, give me a clue!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You will do so when it is appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Okay, there is an issue here and it is just not the appropriate time to address it. Jan asked about the significance of the circle of daggers...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Circles are always significant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Well, the only way out of a circle of daggers is through the center... (L) Or up... (T) The daggers may not be pointed at him to take him out but to limit him... or to move him to the center... (L) Once before you told...

      <p class="answer">
        A: Are you trying to coerce a response?

      <p>
        Q: No, I&#39;m just trying to be sneaky!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Well, forget it!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Does this have to do with getting Charles... is this whole thing designed to get Charles to take charge the way he is supposed to... to get his center back...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are making a mountain where the universe sees a molehill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Okay, change gears: I read the other day that the word &#34;Iscariot&#34; means &#34;from Sikarios,&#34; and this connects the Jesus story directly to my Paran Sikarios... the Percys, piercing, PS, etc. Could you comment on the fact that Judas Iscariot was &#34;from Sikarios.&#34; Was he a member of the Paran Sikarios, the Assassini, a dagger man?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are not to be told some things yet, because of your tendency to share before realizing the ramifications it can bring to your doorstep.
