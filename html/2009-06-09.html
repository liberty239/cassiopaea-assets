        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) This is where I start to get nervous. What if they don&#39;t answer?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Cassiopaea will not let you down!!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (laughter) (L) And who do we have with us tonight?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Fortunaea which reminds us that you might like that from Carmina Burana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Discussion of Carmina Burana)
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Some of those lyrics are truly ancient even if the music is not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Questions? (J) What caused the destruction of the Air France flight?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Cometary explosion of the Tunguska variety though higher and a bit smaller.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Well, that&#39;s what we said in the beginning. Around here that&#39;s what I was saying, although there were some people who were doubting me, and saying &#34;impossible!&#34; (Ark) No. (L) Yes! (Ark) Improbable. (L) Well you said it was probability zero, and I said it was nonzero. (Ark) Probability that we meet was zero! (An**) Do the authorities know about this and are they trying to cover it up?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Some do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (J) What a way to go... all of a sudden. (L) But I guess if you&#39;re going to go out in a blaze of glory, that&#39;s the way to do it. (Ar**) It&#39;s the quickest way.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: A ticket to 5D naturally! They chose the exit at some level. The days will come when the dead seem blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Discussion of grim answer)
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: For some.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar***) Are they talking about in the next 20 years?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Less.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar**) Oh god... (Alenl) In the next year?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Five.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar**) So what&#39;s going to happen in the next five years that&#39;s going to be worse?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Wait and see!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (J) We can give you some hypotheses if you want, Ar**. (Ar**) Okay. (L) We can do it later. Next question? (Chu) What did you think about our music during Craig&#39;s [Art of Living] course?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: You are really grooving!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (laughter) (An**) Is there some connection between people with OCD who recognize patterns easily - are they any less or more likely to be suggestible when it comes to hypnosis or dissociation?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: No. Other factors are related to suggestibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) So what&#39;s on your mind about it? (An**) I was just thinking that it was kind of seeming hard for me yesterday to get into the trance mode ({during Kriya}. I noticed I was thinking a lot, counting, recognizing patterns of breathing and focusing on it, and I was wondering if that was prohibiting me from going into a trance state. Is there any connection?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: You are much less externally suggestible though very internally suggestible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (An**) You mean I suggest things to myself and then listen to myself?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: More or less.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (An**) Alright, change subject! (laughter) (Allen) I have a question. Did I remember correctly, or did I make it up in my own mind when I remembered telling my mom as a kid that the world would end around the time that I was fifty years old?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Your memory is good though your prediction is slightly off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Okay, we want to know what is the root cause of P&#39;s partial arm paralysis. Is it because of his dietary changes and taking {too much} magnesium and so forth?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Not really. It is very much psychosomatic though there is a strong physical predisposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (P) How to change or reduce the psychosomatic factors?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: This is going to require work. The main issue is the relationship with the mother. The left side represents the mother and feminine energy. You feel paralyzed by your relationship with your mother and the anger that is unexpressed is turned on yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (P) [something about memories of past abuse] is it my imagination, or is there something there?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: There is nothing wrong with your memory either!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) It&#39;s funny that after you {began} talking about this, that not long after that is when this {paralysis problem} began. (P) So, it means that... (Ar**) You need to calm your rage somehow. (L) Or express it.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: It is a terrible thing to be used by your mother and thus betrayed to the core.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (P) Does it mean I have to forgive her, to love her, despite this past?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: What did we just say about unexpressed rage? What is loving and forgiving going to do for what is bottled up inside you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (P) It means I have to express rage, this rage and anger that is inside me...
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: There are several nondamaging ways to do this, also. It would do absolutely no good to express it overtly toward your mother, though it would be helpful for you to limit interactions strictly for the duration of the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) So in other words, they&#39;re not saying, &#34;Dump on your mother.&#34; That&#39;s not a good thing. (Ark) What did we learn about nonexpressing of negative emotions. (L) You have to find a way of channeling them out without creating more damage. (Craig) Would regular Kriya help this?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Very helpful, yes!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ark) You see, the first thing I think is just to admit facts about your feelings, admit that you ARE enraged, and then to look objectively at the whole situation and find the best solution without hiding. (L) You&#39;re going around hiding this, like your arm. (Allen) The very first thing you thought of was loving and forgiving her - just pushing the whole thing under the rug. (P) Yeah. (L) The way a dog returns to its vomit. (P) I wasn&#39;t sure [about the memories] because I was so young. I had glimpses and hints. Now I am more sure and I can do something with that. Otherwise I&#39;m not sure, and feeling guilty to have such bad thoughts about my mother...
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Guilt is part of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) So in other words, you are feeling guilty because you wrote what you wrote about your mother ... For thinking it, for talking about it! (P) Is it that I feel guilty because often in {child abuse}, you see the victim feeling he was guilty, he was responsible... (J) But P, you were a child then. (P) I know, but...
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Sexual feelings are natural. It is the duty and responsibility of the parent and all adults to not take advantage of the young in this respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (J) They said there was a strong physical predisposition. I was wondering if there was anything he could take that would help him...
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: The old injury that has been discussed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) So, they&#39;re probably related. (Chu) So, working on that injury would help the process?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes. It might also help to get &#34;Rolfed&#34;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Deep tissue massage.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: It can help to release emotions held in the tissues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) So you&#39;re gonna have to get rolfed and do Kriya at the same time! (Allen) And express rage. (L) Believe me, if you get rolfed, you&#39;ll express your rage! (laughter) (Craig) Would it help for P to do an advanced course [of the Art of Living]?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Alright. Next topic? {...} (P) I wanted to ask a question about this martial arts school I was in, when we were uniting our crown chakras. Were we uniting chakras?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Not likely, but you could figure that out. Stop being so gullible and inclined to believe in illusions when you know better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Next? {...} (Gaby) Whose voice did we hear a couple days ago when we were doing the breathing exercises?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Alternate reality bleedthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar***) Was what we were doing caused that?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Opened portal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Let&#39;s ask about the Art of Living, the breathing and so forth. Does anybody want to formulate a question or two here? (discussion of question to ask) {...} (An**) Why did I see a menorah today during the {Kriya}?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: There have been a lot of bleedthroughs here. Recall your past life!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (An**) I was a Jew?!
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar**) I was a celebrity?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Maybe!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ari**) Oh, be quiet! (An**) Was I a nice Jew?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes...
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (An**) What does that mean?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: That life didn&#39;t end well. Connect your resistance to external suggestion and need for internal suggestion to the menorah and the pain and tragedy of that experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar**) That is so evil.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: You are safe now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar**) So you were a Jew who was captured by the Germans, huh? Poor An**! No wonder you hate them so much. Do you? Do you dislike the Germans? (An**) Not all of them. (laughter) (J) You&#39;ll end up hating the Zionists if you... (L) She was one. A German Jew. (An**) Wow, I really have a past to contend with. (Ar**) Can I ask one last &#34;Ar** question?&#34; Are there any monsters living in caves in France?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (laughter) (An**) There has to be at least one cave monster question per session with Ar**. (Ar**) I don&#39;t have to go to Malta!!! Which direction, north, south, Paris, east, west - what caves?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Massif Centrale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar**) Where is it? (L) Don&#39;t encourage her! (P) Is it related to the beast of Gévaudan?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (P) Does that mean that the beast that was sighted in the eighteenth century is still there?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Or a relative and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (P) But there are no reports like in the eighteenth century.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Wait for the window to open again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (P) It will come back. (An**) When it came the first time it was...
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: That one was someone&#39;s &#34;pet&#34;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar**) Is there a way to track them so I can find them? I just want to take a picture.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: No dice!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (A**) Oh come on, tell me!
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Believe us, you don&#39;t want a picture!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (J) A 4D lizzie&#39;s pet that got off the leash...
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Remember the &#34;Cheddar&#34; monster? That was a young one!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (laughter) (discussion of bigger, uglier monster) (Craig) About the UK, are they trying a coup to replace the government in the UK?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Just getting the pathological types in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (J) That&#39;s what we suspected, ya know? Vin was saying it seemed like a cleaning, like they were getting rid of people with this scandal. (P) I found some statements from Daniel Cohn-Bendit of the Green party, he made some statements in 1996 that he was a pedophile. But there was no quote, no judgment, nothing. So I wanted to know if he was bluffing, or if it was true?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Why would anybody bluff about that? P, you really need to start using your gray matter more!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) You have all that gray matter, and you&#39;re not using it. You&#39;re letting your emotions rule your life. (Allen) And your arm is probably only the beginning if nothing changes I would imagine. (J) Back to breathing? (L) Yes. So, what do you think of this Kriya?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Great stuff, eh? Lighten up on the fluff though.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (J) Would the fluff be... (Craig) The drumming?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Drumming is good and intense. There is too much &#34;free time&#34; in altered states.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (J) Remember what I was saying yesterday about how there was too much time when we were just lying there and nothing was being said... that should be guided.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: When you sweep the house and leave it clean if you do not decide what to put back in then others will do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Craig) Does that apply to this group, or the public in general?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Not this group. But definitely those who have not integrated consciousness. The breathing is a tool, a technique, and should be seen as such and not as the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) That make sense? (Craig) Yup. (J) Should there be any modifications to the breathing? (Allen) Yeah, is the breathing as it&#39;s taught now good enough?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes but your earlier observations were valid and most useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) I guess when we were talking about the &#34;huh&#34; thing to get rid of anger - maybe that should come at the beginning? But I guess that would depend on the individual and what their problem was. Some people might not be able to release. I guess it would have to be different at different times, depending on the group, depending on the problem, depending on the instincts of the facilitator. (J) What about the question we raised about the staring and suggesting you take the other person in your heart. (Craig) Is there any danger in the eye gazing?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes, as with everything. But knowledge protects. That particular part is a bit of the New Age fluff. Gazing and unifying exercises should be undertaken with some care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Like I said, I think that would be really good with couples. (A**) Yeah, it&#39;s kind of a personal, intimate thing, when you&#39;ve already decided that you like somebody. (J) That&#39;s a good angle, Craig, couples&#39; breathing! (Craig) That&#39;s what Kama Sutra&#39;s for! (laughter) (J) No, I don&#39;t mean... you can tailor it, ya know? You could have some kind of ideas to bring couples together, or for people who are having problems with their relationships... (Ark) But this may be against the original Indian way. (J) But this is for a New Age, Arky! (Ar**) This is evolution, people! This is going boldly where no one&#39;s gone before. (L) Well, I think that, as far as I can tell, even though there&#39;s a lot of patristic ponerization in Indian society and thought, they do seem to be relatively free of raving psychopathy. So, in that society, it&#39;s not so dangerous - but in Western society, a society that has grown up out of the Judeo-Christian psychopathic... (Craig) Okay. How do psychopaths or OPs respond when they first do the Kriya?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Depends upon the individual. But in general, since it is mostly a physiological process, they can certainly fly under the radar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Craig) Does this provide any protection to do eye gazing, the fact that Kriya has come before?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: No. In fact since organic portals are mostly emotion reaction machines they might seek out the process for catharsis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Craig) Should I drop it from the courses? (L) Drop what? (Craig) Eye gazing.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: We hesitate to tell anyone what to do, but in this case we suggest that, yes, it would be safer. ... [letters come very quickly] Do not get lost in an illusion that a breathing technique can protect from psychopathy! Only knowledge can do that, and sometimes it takes a long time to acquire the data to make a determination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) That was pretty strong. (L) So don&#39;t think that breathing and prana... I think we ought not lose site of the fact that psychopaths and OPs and all living beings use prana. (An**) Yeah. (L) And they like it. It&#39;s life force. (Craig) Does this Kriya have any possibility of rehabilitation for OPs?

          A: Why do they need to be &#34;rehabilitated&#34;? Do you want to &#34;rehabilitate cows&#34;?
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (laughter) (Craig) Moo! (Chu) Ohmoo! (L) I mean, obviously it helps them. They get prana, too. (Craig) Yeah, the thing is that might be more dangerous. (L) Well, the thing is that I think that people have the wrong idea about OPs. I think that OPs are a normal, natural part of the landscape. They are useful, beneficial - as long as they are in their place and doing what they&#39;re supposed to be doing, what they&#39;re created to do. And as long as they have the proper guidance. It&#39;s not something to be afraid of. I mean, you don&#39;t want to be married to them or have intimate relations with them, because then they hook in and directly drain your energy. But being afraid of them, that&#39;s the whole wrong attitude. We&#39;ve had a couple here that we&#39;ve studied long and hard and carefully, and they are what they are. They&#39;re emotional and they can be loving towards animals, loving towards their children and families. They can be good householders. (Allen) Also, &#34;rehabilitate&#34; assumes that there is something wrong with them. (Craig) They&#39;re blocked from any spiritual development. (J) What do you mean by rehabilitate an OP? (L) Make them not OPs? (Craig) Well, no, help them evolve. (L) Well, they evolve by receiving proper guidance for how to live their lives. And in that sense... (Ark) The point is not to expect from an OP that he will behave like a non-OP. (Craig) Well, that&#39;s not my question, my question was... (Allen) What you specifically asked was can they be rehabilitated, and rehabilitation is something you do with someone who was up here, and fell down here. Something happened to them and they got... OPs are just OPs. (L) Oh, well you were thinking... (Craig) Well, because I worked with prisoners. (L) Yeah. (J) Well, then the question shouldn&#39;t be... (L) Here, let&#39;s ask.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Most of the prisoners are not OPs. Most OPs are very good &#34;citizens.&#34;

          Q: (Ar**) It&#39;s like a toaster. Toasters are useful, they toast, and you can give them the ability to toast better, but it will always be a toaster. And you don&#39;t want to sleep with a toaster because that would really hurt. (Craig) I suppose this gets into the question of the evolution of individual souls. (J) Kriya could be useful for potentially souled people who are in struggle, or souled people who are in struggle. (Craig) So, is there a benefit for OPs to do Kriya?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Of course!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Benefit, just not rehabilitation. I think it&#39;s beneficial for everybody. Except that psychopaths might...
        </p>
        <p>
          [Second Tape is inserted]
        </p>
        <p>
          (L) As your question. (Craig) So, are OPs in the public signing up to the Art of Living course? Is this a concern?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: No.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) My guess would be that they would sign up, probably in numbers equal to potentially souled people because they have probably as often as anybody else trauma in their backgrounds, or being abused, or... (Craig) So I want to ask the same question about psychopaths. Is this a problem?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Oh indeed. Especially as the process becomes more widely known.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) It&#39;s just something you&#39;re going to have to deal with, situation by situation, just like we do with our groups. We give the benefit of the doubt, we have ways and means of testing. (Craig) But my main concern is to protect other people that go to the course. (Allen) But how do you weed? Psychopaths are not easy to spot. (L) Yeah, the good ones are really hard to spot. ...
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: The main thing to consider is this: As people learn the practice and implement it, their own awareness can grow along with &#34;being&#34;. And  if there is a parallel growth in knowledge  , the Kriya will enhance this knowledge thus the protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) So, it&#39;s like one line of things they need to do, I think. Because it&#39;s clear to me that it&#39;s very helpful. But like they said earlier, you sweep the house out, and if you don&#39;t put something back in that&#39;s the right thing, then somebody else puts it in for you - like religion, society, television, whatever. (J) What specific aspect of what we were doing opened the portal to an alternate reality?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Releasing emotional blockages to awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar**) Who did we hear in the hall? Do they have a name? Was it somebody that we know in another reality?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: It could have been &#34;you&#34; in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (Ar**) That&#39;s what I was thinking. It might have been one of us in another reality in the hall. (An**) What about my flashback or whatever it was to my past life? What happened? How did I die? (L) Which flashback? (J) The menorah one.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Experimented on with biological substances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (An**) Is there anything I can do to work through these emotions from then?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Awareness is the first step. Nothing is totally easy. But practice of Kriya with journaling what emerges and releasing the emotions will get you off to a good start.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (An**) What about G**? Is she okay? {Reference to news that a close childhood friend had just been killed in an accident three days previously.}
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: At last she understands and feels peace. .. She is telling you not to grieve. She didn&#39;t want to experience the things to come. You wouldn&#39;t want her to either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (An**) That was something I was worried about. (L) All of us worried about it. I mean, come on, she&#39;s Lebanese in America. (Craig) Can I ask if the QFG should do the Art of Living course wherever they are?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes. That is already on the agenda!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (J) You have it on the agenda? (L) I did, yeah. It&#39;s on my agenda. We&#39;ve gotta warn them about the gazing though. (Craig) That&#39;s worth asking: Should we warn the local QFG group about eye gazing?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (J) That would be an easy one for most of them. (L) Yeah, they wouldn&#39;t like it. They would feel instantly invaded. (J) They would come up with the same concerns that we have. (Chu) Can I ask a question? For about a month now or so, I get these visions when I&#39;m about to fall asleep that there&#39;s something from a past life that is preventing me from seeing something in the present. Maybe from one or several past lives, I dunno. I would like to know if that&#39;s true or if there&#39;s something in the present...
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: The past and present are intertwined. The same method will work for you as was suggested for An**.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Alright, does anybody else have any questions? I guess we should ask about our Paleochristianity thing. (J) Last time, they said they were going to tell us how to accelerate the process...
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: At this point you already know the answers after having brainstormed about it today, along with a direct message from us during the Kriya!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) So in other words, that was a message about the transcripts [that Laura received doing the Kriya]. To put those things together in order to understand the point. Is that it?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: Yes. We&#39;ve been giving you the keys for years now! It is getting time to use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: (L) Any more questions? Is there anything that we haven&#39;t asked that we should have asked? Consider it asked. (laughter)
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A: No dice! Goodbye.
