        A: Cassiopaea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Why is it every time we communicate with you Cassiopaeans we get a different person?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>

        Q: (L) Who is the energy disbursed to?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In other words, if there is a large mass you are trying to transfer, is the problem partly because the mass itself spreads out over such a large area of space/time and must be transferred in stages or something along that line?

      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        {This term, &#34;Level 1&#34; comes up over and over again throughout the text when a &#34;predestined mission&#34; is being discussed. So, we might assume that &#34;hypnotized level 1&#34; refers to behavior that is simply driven from the inner self with, perhaps, no conscious understanding of why one is being so driven.}

        {Z. Sitchen writes: The Mesopotamian texts that refer to the inner enclosures of temples, or to the heavenly journeys of the gods, or even to instances where mortals ascended to the heavens, employ the Sumerian term mu or its Semitic derivatives shu-mu (&#34;that shich is a mu&#34;), sham, or shem. Because the term alos connoted &#34;that by which one is remembered,&#34; the word has come to be taken as meaning &#34;name.&#34; But the universal application of &#34;name&#34; to early texts that spoke of an object used in flying has obscured the true meaning of the ancient records. Thus G.A. Barton (The Royal Inscriptions of Sumer and Akkad) established the unchallenged translation of Gudea&#39;s temple inscription - that &#34;Its MU shall hug the lands from horizon to horizon&#34; - that &#34;Its name shall fill the lands.&#34; A hymn to Ishkur, extolling his &#34;ray-emitting MU&#34; that could attain the heights of Heave, was likewise rendered: &#34;Thy name is radiant, it reaches Heaven&#39;s zenith.&#34; Sensing, however, that mu or shem may nean an object and not &#34;name,&#34; some scholars have treated the term as a suffix or grammatical phenomenon not requiring translation and have thereby avoided the issue altogether. It is not too difficult to trace the etymology of the term, and the route by which the &#34;sky chamber&#34; assumed the meaning of &#34;name.&#34; Sculptures have been found that show a god inside a rocket-shaped chamber, as in this object of extreme antiquity [...] where the celestial nature of the chamber is attested by the twelve gloves decorating it. Many seals similarly depict a god (and sometimes tow) within such oval &#34;divine chambers&#34;; in most instances these gods within their sacred ovals were depicted as objects of veneration. ...The ancient peoples developed the custom of setting up imitations of the god within his divine &#34;sky chamber.&#34; Stone pillars shaped to simulate the oval vehicle were erected at selected sites... That the purpose of the commemorative stone pillars was to simulat a iery skyship can further be gloeaned from the term by which such stone stelae were known in antiquity. The Sumerians called then NA.RU (&#34;stones that rise&#34;). The Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians called them naru (&#34;objects that give off light&#34;). The Amurru called them nuras (&#34;fiery objects&#34; - in Hebrew, ner still means a pillar that emits light...). &#34;The 12th Planet, &#34; Avon Books, New York, 1978. So, we see where Sitchin is going: a shem is a rocket ship. Never mind the fact that the descriptions in the ancient writings fit much better with the Cassiopaean explanation.}

        Q: (L) Shouldn&#39;t you be able to give prophetic insights? {I was still stuck on the idea that a truly &#34;valid&#34; source would just give reams of prophecies that would come true. But, as we shall see, any source that does so as a &#34;habit&#34; is doomed to failure because of the probabilistic nature of reality. The future is not absolutely fixed! And therefore, only probabilities can be given, and then, only just before the event. However, the cyclical nature of &#34;time&#34; does give us a field of probabilities, and we were learning gradually of what this field consisted.}
