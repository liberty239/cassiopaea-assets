However, soon, everyone will agree that it is 1998, and then it will be, in fact, 1998. So, do you have, for those waiting with baited breath, anything to say about the upcoming year. Of course, I know all the psychics and channels are busily posting all their direful predictions about photon belts, null zones and whatever... a whole new series of dates for this will come, I expect...
      </p>

        A: Are you not yet tiring of such drivel?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Yes, I am extremely tired of such drivel, but you have given some very good predictions in the past, and some that were dead wrong.

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Yes, but... I feel like we are going around in circles and we get vague answers. Yes, we understand the necessity for such answers in some cases, but there are other things going on that we would like to deal with in a little more direct manner.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You get into trouble when you presuppose the nature of the answers to the questions.

        Q: &#39;The first, the Great Pyramid, was formed approximately 6,000 of your years ago. Then, in sequence, after this performing by thought of the building or architecture of the great pyramid, using the more local or earthly material rather than thought form material to build other pyramidal structures.&#39; Now, C&#39;s say: &#39;The Great Pyramid was built by Atlanteans 10,643 years ago.&#39; The problem with this sentence is, we are not specific - we know we mean the Great Pyramid at Gizah.

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: No, that is not when it was built. Did the sentence you took out of the text say Atlanteans? (A) Yes, first you asked when and then by whom...

      <p class="answer">
        A: Atlantean Descendants, not Atlanteans!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) No... once it was said by descendants, and once it was said by Atlanteans. (We check and find that it did say &#39;Atlantean descendants and NOT Atlanteans.) Can we use this process to analyze all the material?

        Q: Is there some issue about asking this question of accuracy that needs to be addressed? One main thing is: the presence of certain persons. Some sessions were more accurate than others depending upon who was present...

      <p class="answer">
        A: You got it!!!

        Q: Therefore, it would be difficult to assess an accuracy rating for the C&#39;s themselves...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Bingo!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: But, we CAN assess the material itself, keeping in mind that some parts can be more accurate than others...

        A: 71.7.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Okay, that takes into account corruption from different people, typos, reconstruction, and so forth. And, the same applies to the Ra Material... (A) Okay, suppose I have a sentence that the Great Pyramid was built 10,000 years ago, but really it was built yesterday, and you would give 70 per cent accuracy to this statement.

      <p class="answer">
        A: No.

      <p>
        Q: But only one word is inaccurate...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are searching for a concrete formula within a vacuum of abstraction. The only way to get an accurate measurement is to wait until you can include the sum total of all the words, then determine accuracy as a percentage of the total. With the total of all words, and each individual word as the unit of measurement. And on that note, until the next time, Good Night.
