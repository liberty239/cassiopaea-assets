      <p>
        Q: (L) What?

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Her essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Were these in any way physical beings on the earth we occupy in space/time from where we are at this moment?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) This happened in a so-called alternate reality?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Is still.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, in some alternate reality, DM is a preying mantis being eating little children?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: And so are you. And all others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) This is an essence of what?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Her being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are these aspects of our being coming to earth as part of the realm border crossing?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are all of us going to have to face these aspects of ourselves as other beings?

      </p>
      <p>

        Q: (L) And how is this going to be affected by the realm border crossing?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Will merge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do we need to do extensive hypnosis to bring these aspects of ourselves up and deal with these things a little at a time?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Will happen involuntarily. Will be like a thermonuclear blast. Message follows: See pattern. Orion, Pleiades, Arcturas, Cassiopaea; check distances from earth; progress locator for wave combined with earth references of space time. For you to figure out. Cross reference channelled messages, printing dates and location. We are where we are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What do you mean you are where you are?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Cross reference Time and distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What book do we need to cross reference?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Any star chart and Marciniak, Arcturas Channel, Orion literature and Us. We speak from &#34;crest&#34; of wave, now, where are we?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is this a riddle?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: From, not of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) You speak from the crest of the wave? (T) Are you riding the wave?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) You said in another reading that you were 6 thousand miles...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Window of transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) We are certainly hoping that you are going to make all of this plain and clear...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: It is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, can you help us poor 2 strand DNA creatures to understand this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: How far away is Cassiopaea?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do we need specific distances?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: General is okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, if we just find the general distances... and does each of these star clusters represent a general area of the wave?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Each represents locator in space time. You can judge speed and ETA by cross referencing distance with publishing dates and these messages from us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I got it! You mean that YOU are the Arcturians, the Pleiadians, and now you are the &#34;Cassiopaeans&#34; because you &#34;are where you are&#34;! And you are riding the wave. Is this wave a straight line connecting all these constellations?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Circuitous or cyclical route.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, is it like a spiral?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So we really need to set up a map so we can draw it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) When we speak from Orion we are &#34;Orions&#34;. When from Pleiades, we are &#34;Pleiadian&#34;, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, all of these channelled books you have mentioned are coming from the same basic source, through different channels, that they are able to connect with because of their different positions in space time and preparation level of the channels, is that correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close. We have given you a Wave crest locator. We are from where we are and speak. Get it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) You are the wave crest?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We are Marciniak&#39;s Pleiadians. We are where we are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So, you are not really Cassiopaeans from the Constellation Cassiopia?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We are Transient Passengers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So, when the wave reaches earth and you are transmitting to somebody else out there you will represent yourselves as the &#34;Terrans?&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: When wave reaches earth, we merge with you.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: (L) When you were at Orion, did you merge with the Orions?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not on same frequency for realm border crossing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What effect did the wave have on the Orion sector?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: None. Already at 4th density level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Where did the wave originate?

        Q: (T) Okay, you are riding on the crest of this wave in 6th density, is this true?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes. We are you in 6th density.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) You are we, that is me Terry, Laura, Jan and Frank?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are you alternate selves extending into higher densities?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: At your current reference point in space time, we are you in the future.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        Q: (T) So, when we move to 4th density and become whole with ourselves, we will know you also for a short time?

      <p class="answer">
        A: Not whole yet when at 4th density.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) But in order to move to 4th density...

        Q: (L) When S__ was under hypnosis she described seeing a fleet of space ships &#34;riding a wave&#34; and this unnerved her. She felt this wave was a fearful, invasion-type thing. Was this you and your wave she was perceiving?

        Q: (T) Since you are riding this wave, in order to communicate, since the wave is what you are using to focus this contact with, and you are, whoever you may be at whatever point the wave is, you gave Barbara Marciniak information under the name &#34;Pleiadians&#34;.
