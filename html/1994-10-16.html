      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, you told us before that he saw or interacted with a holographic projection created by the Lizard Beings. Was that the experience on Mount Sinai?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, well, if he got knowledge from you, did he get this prior to the interactions with the Lizard beings?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes. He was corrupted by imagery. He was deceived by the imagery a la Joseph Smith, for example.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does it have anything to do with our activities?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does it involve other entities that have tried to come through that have blocked the channel?
      </p>

        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are there any exercises we can use to help our bodies transform into fourth density?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Not necessary. It is the soul that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this mean that if we focus on soul development, that at the time of transformation that our bodies will automatically be transformed for us?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No. It is natural process. No preparation is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, if you are meant to transform, you will, if you are not you won&#39;t?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this mean that when my body reacts to certain foods that I should stop eating them? Is my body trying to tell me something?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Up to you. Nothing needs to &#34;tell&#34; you anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Can you clarify that?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Why are you searching for guidance where it is not needed?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In other words, if we just do each day what naturally comes to us as the best choice in each moment, we are on the right track?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Precisely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) I find the information of transforming to the fourth dimension very exciting and natural which is why I ask if this is going to be something I will experience in the future excluding death?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Vague.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) If, theoretically, an individual... I am getting a very unusual feeling right at this moment, why?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Metabolic changes enhanced by accelerated learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is this happening to all three of us?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, as I was starting to say, if, theoretically an individual was to develop in a natural way by making all the proper choices, and was to arrive at the point in time when the major transition is to be made, would that individual&#39;s body pass through into that heightened dimension in a physical state? Remember, this is just a theoretical person...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now suppose this theoretical person were to pass through this transition to the other side, what state would they find their body in? Would it be exactly as it is now in terms of solidity? What would be the experience?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: The key concept here is variability of physicality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this mean that everybody will be different or that an individual will have greater control over the substance and constitution of the body?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Not exactly either. Your physicality will be variable according to need and circumstance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, does this mean that sometimes we will be more of a light body?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this mean that sometimes we will be more of a firm body as we have now?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Will our bodies age differently?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What will be the median lifespan?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: 400 years
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And will those who pass through this transition as, say, 50 year olds, will they have an equal opportunity to live an additional 400 years?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Will regenerate in youthful appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, when you say 400 years, will it be that the plane has a different orbit and that a year will be different?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Will the days be different as to length of time light and dark as they are now?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Not the point. Planet will be 4th density as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) But will the days and nights be different and will the orbit be different? Will the axial angle be changed?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You are thinking in terms of the 3rd level density. The rules will be so totally different that physical inspired comparisons are moot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) But I like the sunshine and birds singing and breezes. I just want to know if those things will be the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: In some fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Can&#39;t you give a few clues?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: We must let you see for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>

        Q: (L) Has she overcome this programming?

        A: You are slipping a bit. Refer to Literature &#34;Bringers of the Dawn&#34;. Challenge will be ecstasy if viewed with proper perspective which is not, we repeat: not of third level reality, understand?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In the reference cited, Joan of Arc is described as feeling ecstatic while burning at the stake. Is that what you mean?

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What do you mean about L***?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Several books I have read have advised moving to rural areas and forming groups and storing food etc...
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) We feel pretty helpless at the mercy of beings who can come in and feed off of us at will. Do we have someone on our side, pulling for our team, throwing us energy or something?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Who do you think you have been communicating with?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Will we go through any periods when we may be cut off from help?
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Oh, I don&#39;t want to suffer!
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I don&#39;t want anybody I love to suffer either. I don&#39;t want any pain. I&#39;ve suffered enough!
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You are stuck at 3rd level tonight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) It&#39;s not just that. There is so much disinformation you just don&#39;t know who to believe... I mean, how do we know we can believe you? There are so many sources out there deceiving and they do it so cleverly. Look at the Bible... for 2,000 years people have been believing that...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: They deceive when you allow it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I know you are supposed to take some things on faith... but, do you see my problem here?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is my problem?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In the recent past you indicated that chapter 24 of Matthew and chapter 21 of Luke, were given by Jesus after his extended sleep state. Now, both of those chapters refer to the present time as being like the days of Noah. Is that a correct assessment?

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, you are saying that if we do what we do because we enjoy it that we will be in the right place at the right time, doing the right thing when whatever happens happens, right?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Would it be better to not do this without request?

      <p>
        A: Visa as explained previously. Everyone will get their own number and it will be a Visa number, the number of the Beast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) &#34;Then I looked and Lo! the lamb stood on Mount Zion and with him 144,000 men who had his name and his father&#39;s name inscribed on their foreheads...&#34; What does that mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: ID. The Lamb is the Leadership council of the world bank. Many will think they are taking the &#34;mark&#34; of God when actually being marked by the Beast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) &#34;And I heard a voice from Heaven like the sound of great waters and like the rumbling of might thunder and the voice I heard seemed like the music of harpists accompanying themselves on their harps...&#34; What is this voice from heaven and the sound like great waters and mighty thunder?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: The return of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) &#34;And they sing a new song... No one could learn to sing that song except the 144,000 who had been ransomed from the earth... you said the 144,000 are the leaders of the world bank and here it says they have been ransomed from the earth at the coming of Christ... it says the 144,000 have not defiled themselves by relations with women for they are pure as virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goes...they have been ransomed...&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Symbolism added later and this is not entirely accurate point. The symbols have been mixed. Tends to encourage elitism and divisiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are the 144,000 good guys or bad guys as we would term them?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Both. But they are ones who have supreme knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are these human beings?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) There will be 144,000 people on the earth who have supreme knowledge?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Approximately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, this 144,000, are we among that number? Just curious.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) &#34;No lie was found to be upon their lips for they are blameless, spotless, untainted without blemish. And I saw another angel flying in midair with an eternal gospel to tell to the inhabitants of the earth, every race and tribe and people, and he cried with a mighty voice: Revere God and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has arrived, fall down before him, pay him homage and adoration and worship him who created heaven and earth and the sea and the springs of water...&#34; What does this tell us?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Added later by questionable source.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) &#34;Then a second angel followed declaring: Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great, she who made all nations drink of the wine of her passionate unchastity...&#34; Who is Babylon and what does it mean she has fallen?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Same as previous answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) &#34;Another angel followed, a third, saying with a mighty voice saying whoever pays homage to the beast and permits his stamp to be put on his forehead or on his hand he too shall have to drink of the wine of God&#39;s indignation and wrath poured undiluted into the cup of his anger, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb...&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Disinformation. Intended to create fear and resistance so that the aliens can feed off of these emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) &#34;Again I looked and lo! I saw a white cloud and sitting on the cloud one resembling a son of man with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp scythe in his hand...&#34; Is that further additions?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) &#34;Another angel came out of the temple saying with a mighty voice to the one sitting on the cloud: put in your scythe and reap for the hour has arrived to gather the harvest for the earth&#39;s crop is fully ripened...&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        A: More fear based disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, I have compared certain passages of Revelations to the work of Immanuel Velikovsky, were those sections accurate in what they describe?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And those are events that will transpire after the Lizzies have done their thing, after the Visa is in place, and before or after Christ returns?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So the cluster of comets is going to come before the return of Christ??
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes. But return is just one event not the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there going to be massive disruption on the planet and maybe a lot of people transitioning out of the body simultaneously because of the interaction of this cluster of comets and the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And, shortly following this event, Christ will return?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: As part of the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) That is going to be part of the cluster of comets activity?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: After.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is Christ going to do after he returns?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) May we assume there will be six billion?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Assume as you please.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) You keep saying that the return of Christ is a part of the whole as though there is some important thing that I am missing the question to discover. Consider that question asked... tell me what it is I am missing, please.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Obvious if you have been paying attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And that is...?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: The transition to 4th density.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is the transition to 4th density going to happen before the comets or after?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: After.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is the interaction of the comets and the planet earth going to....

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it going to generate this change in some way?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) It&#39;s not going to have anything to do with electromagnetic interactions which would heighten the atomic vibrations of the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, the comets are going to make a mess of things and then the transition is going to come as Christ comes?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) The transition will happen and we will all be standing around glazed in the eyes or whatever, wondering what to do with ourselves, because we are finding ourselves in a new estate we have not been in before, and then Christ comes?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: More or less.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, what is going to happen after Christ comes back and everything is sort of straightening out and he is teaching... is everybody on the planet going to be gathered together in one place to receive these teachings?

      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        Q: (L) Are there going to be large groups of people moving into domed cities on the planet living in &#34;cahoots&#34; with the Lizzies?

      </p>
      <p>

      <p>

      <p>
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, in other words, we will have a greatly reduced population, people here and people there, none of whom are totally united on the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Goodnight.
      </p>
