      Because of the question posed here:
      <a href="https://cassiopaea.org/forum/threads/cs-should-come-from-leo-now.20268/" rel="nofollow">

At the time Laura asked what their plan was now, and you said that you could not say because she would seek to reveal it leading to her destruction. So my question is, (with mirth) have we evolved to a high enough degree that we can know now?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You already figured it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: {Everyone looks to Perceval as though he figured something out}. (Perceval) Well I didn&#39;t really figure anything out, I was just thinking about it and decided that the new plan was to introduce the psychopaths in order to effect the total control of the planet along certain lines)

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Perceval) yeah well they&#39;ve set it up with the claims that Iran has thousands of suicide bombers ready to attack the west (L) I think the percentage of people in a population who would be psychologically (prepared to do this) is very small (Perceval) yeah, it&#39;s tiny (L) and therefore the fact that there is this many means that these individuals who are been programmed or worked on psychologically or have been set up and don&#39;t even know that they are suicide bombers, that&#39;s what I would say, because even in a so called &#34;fanatic population&#34; the number of people who actually gonna go and blow themselves up….under any circumstances is real small. I mean, how many suicide bombers have there been in Ireland (Perceval) exactly, none! And among other supposedly &#34;terrorist&#34; wars that has gone on, they don&#39;t do it. (L) yeah, it has been a huge defamation thing. (Galahad) yeah. (Perceval) well they completely denigrated a billion people in the minds of western people as crazy, as people who blow themselves up!

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: 3.2 million.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Mr. Scott) Did they kill them by other means?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes. Shooting, starvation, experiments, diseases including deliberate infection for experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Mr. Scott) Well that&#39;s pretty funny because, if there were no gas chamber, Israel can go in and kill as many Arabs as they want and no one can ever say &#34;you&#39;re doing what Hitler did&#34; because they&#39;ll say &#34;no, we&#39;re not using gas chambers&#34; we&#39;re not that horrid, and yet it never happened.

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Ark) I have to make a break (L) Arm? (Ark) yes. Break, and tape stopped for a few minutes while Ark rested his arm which was getting tired. Discussion of last answer where Perceval states that Cheney is the most disgusting human being ever to walk the planet.

        Q: (Atriedes): Is photo reading in any way successful…
