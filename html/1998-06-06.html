      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, he will have to fill out the paperwork NOW for the teaching, and if he fills it out, he will HAVE to do it because he will be obligated - and that is why it is important to decide now rather than later.

        A: If one is being &#34;killed&#34; by something, and one does not wish to be killed... whatever should one do?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I know. One doesn&#39;t do it. That simple. Okay, now, I was reviewing our Jesus pages for the net, and on the subject of this life of Jesus that you gave, the few details, you mentioned that the biological father of Jesus was an individual named Tonatha. Then, you said that this individual was a member of what you called the &#39;white sect&#39; also known as Aryans. Aryans are not precisely known as a sect, but what sect is there among Aryans that you were referring to; what is it called?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: White sect.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Aramaic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: So, we need to know what it is in Aramaic. What kind of teachings did they follow?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Similar to the monks of orthodox Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: If they were similar to the monks of orthodox Christianity, then the activities of this individual in being the biological father of Jesus, would that not be considered to be breaking one&#39;s monkly vows?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: All can be forgiven a singular indiscretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: So, this Mary knew this individual who was, for all intents and purposes, a monk in this sect and the hypnosis was activated and possibly in him also... was he also hypnotized level 1 as you said about her?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close enough.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Is it true that the Essene community that was attempting to prepare a vessel for the coming of the messiah, that this was their whole plan, their work?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Was progressive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: So, it went on over a period of time. Did he ever know who his biological father was, that his father was a member of this White Sect... did he know that?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Vaguely.
