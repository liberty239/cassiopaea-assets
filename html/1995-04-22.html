      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, you said at that time that a Transdimensional Atomic Remolecularizer was buried at Oak Island. Is that correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      <p>
        Q: (L) What do you mean we already have tools?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      <p>
        Q: (L) And that is, of course, our minds?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You betcha!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Speaking of precious commodities, since my accident, my brain has been doing some very strange things. When I write, I transpose letters. I get blank spots. I have been doing some other very strange things, playing with seeing if I know something and then discovering that I do. It is really kind of strange and I wonder if that accident had anything to do with these strange happenings?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, when I hit my head, I really hit my head! (J) Scrambled your brains.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is the issue? Can you tell me exactly what it did to my head?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is the issue? (J) We were talking about learning. (L) Did this event do something to help me learn in a different way?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Then, I shouldn&#39;t worry about it. (T) Now you have to learn to work with it. (J) Let&#39;s not get sidetracked. (L) Let&#39;s go back to Oak Island. Okay. What I read about Oak Island was that there were legends of lights being seen there prior to 1703.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Prior to 1703 would put the burial of whatever is there at least prior to that time, correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Were those lights the lights of craft of other beings other than the natives of this planet?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Electromagnetic profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What was noticed when the kids arrived on the Island was that a limb was sawed off of a tree over the depression and there were marks of a rope and pulleys having been utilized. (T) If something more advanced dug the pit, they wouldn&#39;t have used chain hoists and pulleys. (L) That is what I am getting at. So, if there was evidence of this kind of stuff on the tree, it would seem to indicate that somebody had been doing something there who was a little more human or limited in their technology, is that correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, my thought is that, it is beyond human technology to have produced that pit at that point in history?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Beyond known technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And yet humans may have been involved in that activity?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Bingo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) Think back to when we were talking about it and you mentioned the lights.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Some humans have always communed with &#34;higher&#34; powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, humans my have actually... (J) Like those little kids that broke into those houses and did all that damage. They could have done it themselves, but they had to be directed to do it. I think it is a good analogy.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not good analogy, we are speaking of conscious communion in this and other and instances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, there was conscious communion between humans and other powers in the building of this pit. What group of humans was this?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) There was the French and the English. How about the Vikings? (F) No, the Vikings were 600 years before that. (T) Well, we don&#39;t know how long ago the pit was dug. (J) I&#39;m still... yeah, good question. (L) When was the pit dug?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: 1500s. Nationality is not issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Well, this pit was dug sometime in the middle of the 1500s. (J) And it was discovered in the 1700s.

        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I think that this may have had something to do with the people that later became known as the Cajuns, a French religious sect that was living there...

        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, this article says that it would have taken a hundred men working every day for six months to have built this pit...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) The article also says that it must have been dug in 1780...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) When they drilled into the pit, some bits of gold came up and a piece of parchment and maybe some other odds and ends. What were these?

        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What did they intend to do with it once it was there? Did someone intend to come back for it at some point in time?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) Maybe it was a lesson. (T) Is it buried there in that location for a specific reason?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does it do something? (T) Does the location itself have something to do with the purpose of it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Magnetic.

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Yeah! That&#39;s what it is all about. We are still third density! If we use...

      <p class="answer">
        A: It&#39;s not nice to fool Mother Cassiopaea!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: {Laughter} (T) Mirth! If we were to follow the coordinates where this thing is buried, would it lead us to others?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      <p>
        Q: (T) Is there a remolecularizer under us?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay. I want to get back to the function of this thing. You say it is buried not to be dug up. It is actually buried to stay there? Is that correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Then that explains a lot of things about the way it was buried. There was found, at a certain level, a rock with carving on it. It was destroyed through carelessness. I am curious as to what this said. Can you access this and tell us what it said?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

        Q: (J) Is this device a doorway for entry into this dimension?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) Is it possibly a lock on a doorway into this dimension?

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) You said that they don&#39;t have to all work at the same time; they can work independently of each other? Are they positioned in such a way if something small happens only a couple of them kick in, but if something large happens, as many as necessary?

        Q: (L) The reason she is concerned is because she read a book that says it takes a while for the soul to completely separate from the body and that there is a &#34;cellular&#34; consciousness that might experience pain for some time after death at least until every little cell dies individually.
