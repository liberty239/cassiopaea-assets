        Frank, Laura, SV
      </p>
      <p>
        We had attended a Christmas party and, after a couple of drinks and snacks, decided we&#39;d rather go home and chat with the Cs. Since I am a teetotaler all year and only take token drinks during holidays, that couple of drinks had an effect on me as you can see from the opening!
