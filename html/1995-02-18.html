      <p>
        Frank, Laura, Terry, Jan, DM
      </p>
      <p>
        {This is one session that I believed to be corrupted. The woman, DM, who attended several sessions, including the one immediately prior to this one, was the probable cause. There was a STRONG conflict between her and Jan. There were a LOT of peculiar things about this whole session, as you will see. It wasn&#39;t just the attitude either. I think one of the clues was when they abbreviated the word &#34;Cassiopaea,&#34; which was odd at this stage of the experiment. }
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do we have anyone with us?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Stop what, our discussion of all this weirdness?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. And it is not weirdness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) What does &#34;Stop&#34; mean?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close doors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, that is weird, they have never been bothered by the household noise before. (We closed the doors.) Who do we have with us tonight?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Teiurannea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, why did you want the doors closed and are you going to give us our answer?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: There is usually too much interference from outside influences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And we have with us...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Living room contains too much noise and static.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, they have never complained about it before... (J) It must be the TV.... (Laura instructs children in the next room to turn down television and get quiet.) Don&#39;t you like Star Trek?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is the problem?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Noise and innocent banter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) It&#39;s the kids. (L) Well, they will be going to bed soon...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You will not have control of this session, so don&#39;t worry about asking silly questions, as before!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, that doesn&#39;t sound very friendly, does it? (T) Are you going to impart some information that you want us to just listen to and absorb?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Sometimes friendliness must be set aside to get your attention and redirect wavelengths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) You have the floor, redirect.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Pause... wait for important information to be directed through our channel. You forgot id inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Where are you from?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Cass. Children are not cooperating. {Laura sends children to bed. Much negative feeling engendered thereby.} Thank you. You need to be more open, remember, we are you!!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who is not being open?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not issue. Can you imagine what it is like to look at yourselves as you once were, and to know you still are, and must communicate with yourself on a most unconventional level for union of purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) No, I don&#39;t think I could imagine that.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Well, try!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I am trying. I guess it would be like looking at yourself as an infant.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Okay. Continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, getting into the mindset of an infant we find that they have very little awareness of what is going on. Their awareness is primarily focused on meeting their personal needs, themselves, food, comfort, and the adult is worried about whether the roof leaks, whether the wind is going to blow the windows in and whether the wolf is going to come howling at the door, is that pretty close?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Progress!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, you find us to be a bit trying at times?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We are you, you are us, we are literally one and the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, you don&#39;t find us trying because it would be difficult to find oneself trying, but it is still possible to be dissatisfied with an aspect of one&#39;s personality? (J) Or, like loving someone and seeing what they could be and being a bit impatient that they are not?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Wow! What a concept!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Alright...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Laura, you still think we are a separate entity from you. You go around saying to people: &#34;The Cassiopaeans said this, the Cassiopaeans said that.&#34; Don&#39;t you know it is you as you will be?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Faced with the fact that they were like this back then and they are trying to deal with it as it is, and they are trying to convince themselves back now, to open up enough to listen to ourselves there... or something similar to that. (J) Well, I think they have patience with us.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close, Terry. It is fun to us to listen to you as you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Cool! It&#39;s nice to know that I am entertaining myself in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: As us!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) But, it&#39;s got to be frustrating because when you were us in your past, in third density, you didn&#39;t know enough to be able to communicate with yourself in the future. (J) Well, maybe they did. You don&#39;t know that.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Wrong! What do you think this is!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) This is the future, the past, the present... (T) But, it is hard for you to understand that now as us stuck in 3rd density... they are me, we are all together, coo coo cachoo! (J) It&#39;s hard for us, it&#39;s not hard for them. (T) They are us, we are them.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not hard for us in either point of reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Then why is it hard for us here to perceive what we there seem to understand? (L) Maybe it is not as hard for us as we seem to think it is. (T) Well, how do we get past it, then? How do we get to the point where we perceive what we need to perceive? (J) Let it go.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are past it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So, just by the fact that we are doing what we are doing, we are past that point. Now, all we have to do is to be able to open up more to be able to do this correctly?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Bingo zingo!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Obviously someone else of us likes to say &#34;Bingo zingo,&#34; which you got from us back then when you were here because I never said &#34;Bingo zingo.&#34; (J) It was Al. (T) Al, the hologram said bingo zingo...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Or maybe you changed and decided you liked to say it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Alright guys, can I ask a question. I have had something bugging me all week.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Ask if you must, but we are going to have fun tonight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) I also want to ask about that sleep interruption I experienced. (T) We always have fun... why don&#39;t we let them run their stuff out... (L) Okay, run your stuff out...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No Laura, we are not the Lizzies; this is Cassiopaea calling. Worry not, channel is now permanently locked in, but damn those tapes!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) You are giving me the heebie-jeebies guys. {I was really feeling that this session was off.}
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are too serious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, somebody&#39;s gotta be!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Well, you were going to give us some important information here... that is what you said in the beginning of this session...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: All in due time, but first, we want to have some fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, go ahead. I want to see this happen, do it.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Lighten up, Laura. This is your other persona talking directly to myself!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) This does not make sense. I don&#39;t like it when I can&#39;t understand it...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Persona. Jan, you always had trouble with the pens and pencils after you/I learned the computer!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) That&#39;s true! I have to block print.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Now it&#39;s me/us, Jan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) So it was your persona talking to you, Laura.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Forget it, Laura, it was just only one of many, many learning experiences! They all enriched us tremendously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What am I supposed to forget that was the learning experience?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Lifetimes of &#34;woe.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Is this one of her/your lifetimes of woe?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: They all are if we choose to view them thusly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) I have a comment to make to the Cassiopaeans. (T) Does this include 4th density life as well? (J) I may have a hard time writing, but half the time I am already anticipating what they are going to say and am writing ahead, so they should cut me some slack. (L) Cut her some slack, guys. (T) Cut, cut!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Slack cutteth!
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) A dear Jan letter! {laughter} (D) I guess I&#39;m sitting over here getting stuff too. I&#39;ve been feeling kind of like a fifth wheel anyway.

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No, LM, Miami Jewishese!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: {Laughter} (LM) I thought they were in Cornucopia, not Miami! (J) Just spit it out! (L) My question is... (T) She forgot! (L) No, I didn&#39;t forget, I just have to figure out how to word this. As you know, I am reading this book about Holocaust victims reincarnating and remembering their experiences at this time. The question is, on one occasion you told us that the Jewish people, as a racial group, were Atlantean descendants, is that correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Some.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) There is some. Can you give us that some?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there some karmic element that was fulfilled by the Holocaust?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Could you tell us what karma was being expunged in that activity, and what group the Jews represented?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: This is not germane, but it was Atlantean overseers &#34;expunging&#34; guilt from that life experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: So what?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) A couple of weeks ago I had an experience where I woke up in the morning and felt as though my tongue had been torn out. I felt the sensation of something unusual having happened. I would like to know what this was. {I actually woke up spitting blood from deep in my throat and it was on the night before I was to have an MRI done.}
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: It is not important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I know you say it is not important, but this had some very serious ramifications for my physical body.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: As always. And, have we not advised to concentrate less upon physicality?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, the point I am trying to get at is, if I was hauled out in the middle of the night by a bunch of Lizzies, or whatever, and worked on, I would certainly like to know about it. I know it&#39;s physicality...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You were not.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Maybe not by Lizzies, but something very strange happened on that night. Something that had been seen in an X-ray was NOT present on the MRI that was done that morning.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay Jan, ask your question, if you dare! (J) If I dare! I had an experience last week where I woke up about 20 minutes after I had gone to sleep, screaming my head off, because there was something standing by the bed. What was that?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Now Jan, you indeed were taken!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who took her?
      </p>

      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) The event seemed to have lasted, in our illusion of time, 20 minutes, because I was in the living room watching the television while this happened. But, the experience that happened to her may have lasted longer or shorter in our perception of time, correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So, when she screamed... (J) Did I stop the abduction by screaming?

        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) I had nothing to do with the ending of the event? Her screaming just alerted me.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You were diverted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Well, that&#39;s easy enough to do for me. I&#39;m easy to divert! Give me a computer screen and I&#39;m diverted.

      <p class="answer">
        A: Ugly is subjective. We are you, Laura.

        Q: (L) I&#39;m not sure I believe that.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Why would we be ugly to ourselves? But we understand imprisonment of physicality and its biological tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What kind of a snide remark was that? (T) They are just telling you that you understand. (D) We are just talking back and forth to ourselves. (T) They are us. We are us.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Snide is your, and also our, perception. Alas.

        Q: (L) In other words, be grateful that it wasn&#39;t worse. (D) I would like to ask a question because you probably understand it and I do not. If we are 6th and we are also 3rd, in the future, will we be another 3rd and another 6th... (F) In our 3rd density perception, since our time is linear and we are looking at us in the future, talking back to us in the present, but it is all happening at once because there is no real time. And, probably, I guess this also means that one day, which is also today, we will be 6th looking down here... (D) We will be doing the same thing over and over? (F) Sort of yes and no... I don&#39;t think we can quite grasp the whole thing... (T) The problem is...

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Even at 4th we will understand more than we do now. They are giving us concepts that are beyond third level. They are working with us to prepare us so that when we move into 4th we will have a head start on what&#39;s going on. They are bringing us up to where we already are because we came from 4th level to come here to do this originally, to set the frequency and hold it so that others can move to 4th level. We came from 4th density to do this. They are trying to give us enough information so that we will remember... (F) It is kind of like Hansel and Gretel going into the forest and leaving a trail of crumbs so that they can find their way out. We came back from 4th to 3rd to do what we&#39;ve got to do and we&#39;re going back to 4th but we&#39;ve got to leave a trail for us to keep connected to where we came from... something similar to that, in any event. (F) Is your mind exploding, D__? (T) We, where we are now, don&#39;t grasp all this because we are not supposed to at this level.
