        After a brief encounter with an easily identifiable &#34;dead dude,&#34; whom we sent away, we used our Reiki symbols, asked specifically for our communicants from Cassiopaea and the following came through:

      <p>
        Q: We want to communicate with the Cassiopaeans.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: I am Ra keeper of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What are you here to tell us?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: UFO not all bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Why is the connection so bad tonight?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You see you are tired.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: [Unknown question.]
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Level through 6.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: [Unknown question.]
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: [Unknown question.]
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Always. Please let me go.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was clear that the energy was very weak on this last contact. It was also curious that the character &#34;Ra&#34; came through and identified himself as a &#34;keeper of light.&#34;
