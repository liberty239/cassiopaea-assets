      <p>
        {the guests, “D” and “Chuck” were problematic for a number of reasons. Chuck was a PI who had worked with me on an abduction case. He wasn’t really “into” the paranormal and asked to attend just out of curiosity. “D” is the woman who appears at a couple other sessions and was discussed in “The Wave” as the science teacher who claimed, under hypnosis, to have been affiliated with preying mantis type aliens.}

        A: Just trust your extraordinary abilities!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) What they are trying to tell you is to go with what you think is right because it will be right, because it is coming from within you, and it&#39;s not so much whether you&#39;ve touched here, or touched there, it&#39;s that wherever you&#39;ve touched is the intent. It&#39;s what they say, intent is what it is. (S) But the way the law of this country and state goes, you also have to have that piece of paper that says yes, you can do this.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Bravo, Terry!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Thank you, thank you! (L) Well, go ahead and get the licensing and do what feels right. You&#39;re doing the right stuff.

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Humor the authorities, they know not any better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (S) Why am I so reluctant to use some things, is it because I&#39;m going to too many classes, too many different schools of thought, that I&#39;m getting confused?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Lose the fear and just do it! Welcome, Chuck, you were a &#34;wild one&#34; in youth, eh? Lady Killer. Mirth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: [Laughter.] (L) We&#39;re going to go on with our questions and see how many we can cram into this session. (D) Monday is the 23rd, my house is supposed to sell. My Realtor is sweating blood.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Did we not tell you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Yeah, you did. (L) The van I looked at today, is there anything significantly wrong with it that doesn&#39;t show up, or that I have missed, that we have missed, is it as good a deal as it seems to be?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, that&#39;s all I wanted to know. Back in the 1970&#39;s in the Central United States there were quite a number of cases of animal mutilation. There has been a lot of publicity about this at some point and then it died down and was covered up, and there were a lot of ideas and theories about it. What I would like to know is who was doing the animal mutilations?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Many.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Okay, who was doing most of the animal mutilations?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Okay. Was some of the animal mutilation done by the U.S Government, or entities within the government?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Was?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In other words, it is still going on. So Okay, so they are still doing it. Was, or is, some of this activity being conducted by alien individuals?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Were they acting for the same reasons?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Why did the government do animal mutilations?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Copy, in order to throw off investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So they copied this activity to throw off investigations. Did they do this as an act to protect the aliens who were doing animal mutilations for their own purposes?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Were they doing it to protect themselves from the public knowing that they were engaged in alien interactions?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: They do it to protect the public from knowing that which would explode society if discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is this item that they were protecting so that society or the public wouldn&#39;t know about it. What activity is this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Humans eat cattle, aliens eat you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) They&#39;ve said that before. (L) Okay, yeah, we eat second level, they eat third. Did aliens do some of the cattle mutilations?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What do aliens do to cattle?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) They take the blood out of them?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) They drink it? What do they use this blood for?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Nourishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, but you just said that aliens eat humans, and humans eat cattle. Why were the aliens being nourished by cattle, if that&#39;s not their normal bill of fare? (J) Delicacy. (T) A cow&#39;s blood is a lot like human blood.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Do you not ever consume facsimile?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Hamburger helper? Shake and Bake, (J) And I helped! [Laughter] Sorry!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Facsimile is less controversial, obviously!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So in other words, they were eating cattle just to keep from having to eat so many humans, that would have just upset people a lot, is that it? Oh god.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So, since they&#39;re eating cattle instead of humans, does that mean they&#39;ll stop eating humans? (L) Terry, you know better than that! (T) Well, it&#39;s the next logical question.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Some of their human &#34;food&#34; is merely emotions, think of flesh as being the equal of &#34;filet mignon.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Some of their food is merely emotions. Okay, when we&#39;re talking about these aliens, are we talking about the Grays?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) We&#39;re talking about the Lizards.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Okay, what do the Grays feed on?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Plasma.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Okay, the Grays feed on plasma, blood plasmas of some kind, is this what you are saying?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Okay, so that&#39;s why they want the blood; so, do the Grays feed on emotions?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Okay,
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: They send them to Lizards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) The Grays send emotions to the Lizards? They&#39;re transmitters?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Transfer energy through technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Let me ask this... (T) Are the cattle giving off enough emotion for the Grays to feed this to the Lizards also?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. That is physical only, you see, Lizards and Grays only need physical nourishment while &#34;visiting&#34; 3rd level, not when in natural realm, 4th density, there they feed on emotions only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Grays are not strictly third density? Because they&#39;ve been created by the Lizzies?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes. Correct, they too are 4th level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, let me ask, while we&#39;re on this subject, real quickly, we need to move on to cover these questions. Actually, it becomes moot, since we know their technological capabilities. What technology do they use to surgically excise certain areas of the cattle&#39;s anatomy, is this done by laser...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Laser-like
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, since it has been noted that quite frequently the cattle mutilations consist of taking very specific parts of the body, such as the eyeballs, the genitalia; they core out the anal sphincter right up to the colon; what would be the purpose for these specific body parts? I mean, do they core out the rectum and put a pump on there and suck all the blood out, I mean... (T) That&#39;s what the tail&#39;s for! It&#39;s a pump! (L) Why? Why do they do this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Close? I&#39;m close?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes. Not the tail part, ha ha!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, I think we kind of have an answer to this one, but there have been very frequently associated with the phenomenon of cattle mutilations, sightings of black, unmarked helicopters, who or what are these helicopters?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are some of these helicopters disguised alien craft? Are some of these helicopters the property of the U.S. Government?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes to both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Are some of these helicopters private enterprise? A:
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Oh, boy Terry, you had to do that! A whole new can of worms!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: All are interconnected
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, I want to ask this one, because this is one I haven&#39;t hit lately. Wendelle Steven&#39;s, who was associated with Billy Meier, and also Genesis 2 or 3, put out the Billy Meier book on the Billy Meier sightings....
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Some too, are projections, this phenomenon is multifaceted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I expect that goes back to the black helicopters. I want to know about Wendelle Stevens, associate of Billy Meier...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Why? This is wasted energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I just want to know how reliable he is. In a word, is this person somebody who can be relied upon for factual information, yes or no?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, that&#39;s good enough. Who are the oriental- appearing personnel that have been seen manning the helicopters and the white vans that have been sighted all over the country?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: MIB.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Talk about opening up another can of worms! (L) I&#39;m not even going to touch that one!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: And government copycats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, now, I have a list of names, and I want a yes or no as to whether these individuals were - because I believe most of them are deceased right now, this is just a little verification on some other things for the general public - were these individuals involved in the cover-up of the UFO activity and phenomenon in the U.S.?:

        Dr. Lloyd B. Berger (Yes)
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Who is in MJ12 now?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Will not reveal as you would be terminated if this information were to be let out, so forget it now!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Does MJ12 still exist?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: In different form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I would like to know who sent the MJ 12 documents to Jamie Shandera? Who sent those documents to him?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Bill Cooper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Who sent them to Cooper?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: He discovered them in records review.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) He is the one who discovered the MJ 12 documents? Does he claim he sent them? (T) Yes. (L) How did you know that and I didn&#39;t know that? (T) I read the Cooper book, the early Cooper papers.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Cooper was unintended security leak, then &#34;turncoat.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Okay, so he found all this out when he was working for the government...

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Well Okay, while we are on the subject... I don&#39;t want the names of those involved with MJ12, the question is, if you gave us the names, how many of those people would we know? Not personally, but how many would we know? How many would we have heard of?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: One or two maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Which is what I figured. Just like back in the 40&#39;s you wouldn&#39;t have known who these people were. Hillencotter and Forrestal, maybe, because they were WWII people, their names were in the paper. Unless you were into sciences, you wouldn&#39;t know who these people were. (L) How many alien craft, actual alien craft, are in the hands of the government or this consortium?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: 36
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And were these captured craft? Or gifted?

        A: And recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Ok, they were all three. Were any of them purchased?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not correct concept, Grays are not financial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) I didn&#39;t mean by money, I meant purchased as in some kind of a trade. A gift is something that is given without anything in return (J) We give them something in return. (T) Were the gift ones not what we would really consider gifts, but they were given to us in return for something else, some other kind of payment? Barter?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
