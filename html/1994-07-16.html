        End of Session
      </p>
      <p>
        [1] A few weeks prior to this session, we had asked about aliens while sitting on the board. The word &#34;Ra&#34; had been spelled out several times, and we were completely puzzled by this until I came across an ad in a magazine for a book entitled &#34;The Ra Material,&#34; that was supposed to have been channeled from an &#34;ancient astronaut.&#34; I ordered the book, and read it. I immediately knew that this was important material and even though we were becoming weary of our long vigil at the board, when I read about the many years this group put into a similar project, I took heart and, instead of giving up, as I was tempted to do, we persisted.
      </p>
      <p>
        [2] This was an unusual name. Up to this point in time, the names we had been given had all been, more or less, familiar. Names like &#34;Dave&#34; or &#34;John&#34; or &#34;Mary&#34; were not uncommon with the &#34;dead dude&#34; type contacts. Some of them even used archaic, but still familiar names like &#34;Agamemnon&#34; or &#34;Aquila.&#34; So, a completely unfamiliar name with no known connection was a first.

        [3] This remark about the &#34;Sun in Libra&#34; becomes extremely important later on, so it was interesting that this was brought up at the very first session.

        [4] The term &#34;Corsoca&#34; was one of the first &#34;clues&#34; about hidden things in our reality the Cassiopaeans gave that related almost directly to a particular written work. In Jacques Vallee&#39;s book,  Revelations  , at the beginning of each section, there are quotes from Cassilda&#39;s Song in  The King in Yellow  , Act 1, Scene 2, by Robert W. Chambers. The Song goes:
      </p>
      <p>
        Strange is the night where black stars rise,
      </p>
      <p>
        And strange moons circle through the skies,
      </p>
      <p>
        But stranger still is... Lost Carcosa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Songs that the Pleiades shall sing,
      </p>
      <p>
        Where flap the tatters of the King,
      </p>
      <p>
        Must die unheard in ... Dim Carcosa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the shore the cloud waves break,
      </p>
      <p>
        The  twin suns  sink behind the lake,
      </p>
      <p>
        The shadows lengthen... In Carcosa.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, of course, having just read this poem, I was immediately struck by the similarity of Corsoca to Carcosa. The reference to Twin Suns was also significant later on, but not of any significance to us at this point. Finally, considering the state of the world at present, the description of &#34;Lost, Dim Carcosa&#34; become particularly poignant.

        [5] Bob Lazar is a fellow who claims to have worked at Area 51 on retro-engineering alien space craft that had been captured by the U.S. government. He talks about his experiences in a video presentation that is well worth watching. In this video, he mentions having read a Top Secret-Eyes Only file on the subject of aliens, in which it was said that they repeatedly refer to human beings as &#34;containers.&#34; This struck me as extremely curious, and I didn&#39;t think that the standard explanation of a body as a &#34;container&#34; for the soul was exactly what was meant. We had been discussing this video while sitting at the board earlier in the evening, so that is why the question was asked.
