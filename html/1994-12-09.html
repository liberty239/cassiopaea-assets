      <p>
        Q: (L) Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And who do we have with us this evening?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: {Name lost}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And where are you from?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Cassiopaea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, tell me the name of the beings D__ M__ experienced as preying Mantises in her hypnosis session?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Her essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) But, in that reality don&#39;t they have a name?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Too complex to answer adequately in this medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, you said that the beings that V__ encountered were Minturians, aren&#39;t they the same?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there a difference between essence beings and incarnate beings?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So we have a distinct difference. Okay, who were the ant/fly beings she described?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Her essence too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And what were those snakey, slug-like beings that she saw?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are you saying that all of this stuff is who she is? All of these horrible creatures and these..
      </p>
      <p>
        A: In some of the alternate realities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do I have creatures like that that are my essence?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) My essence is something that horrible and dark and icky?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, weren&#39;t those horrible icky beings eating little children? Weren&#39;t those real human children?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: How do you think you are viewed by deer, for example?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I can immediately see that. I saw that already. I mean, cows and chickens would have to view us that way. I mean, it&#39;s pretty gross.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Roaches, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is that why the night before D__&#39;s session, I dreamed of ants that I could have stepped on and smashed, and for some reason I decided I did not want to take the life of even a single ant?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Was that dream preparing me for what I was going to experience in that session?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, what do we do about these essence parts of ourselves? I mean, I don&#39;t like it that there may be something of the predator in me. I would like to not have it, or get rid or it, or transform it, or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Wait and see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, am I going to have to remember myself doing things like that in order to come to terms with it?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is that going to happen to me, that I am going to have memories like that surfacing?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I can&#39;t even cope with it in someone else, how am I going to deal with it in myself?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is this something we are all going to have to do?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: All eligible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And who is eligible?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: 4th density candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is Frank going to have to remember these things, too?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) How does one know that one is a 4D candidate?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You gradually &#34;awaken&#34;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are my children 4D candidates? And my husband? You have to tell me this. If I have to deal with things, let me do it a little at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You are not in correct frame of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, that sounds ominous.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Wait for answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Wait until when?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You are ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, in other words, some people may have to leave behind children or mates, or siblings or parents, is that true?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: If so, will be prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there any way to tell if someone is a 4D candidate?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Inquire of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And, will they know?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes, at some level. In a sense. Those who are chosen feel it. You will know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I happen to think that my family is extremely special.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: So do all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I have taken a great deal of time and care with spiritual matters. Is that because it was my obsession or did they choose me because of this?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Did the Minturians, the preying mantis beings that V__ experienced in her regression, did those preying mantises eat people?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Too complex for your thought patterns of this session. You are upset.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, is that what is wrong with me tonight. You aren&#39;t telling me much.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Biological, and we are telling plenty, you are not &#34;hearing&#34; because biological factors have temporarily pushed you back more into 3D.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Would it be a good idea to do the Reiki exercises and stop the cycle?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Your cycle may stop soon anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, is it true that that exercise, when it stops your cycle, it also stops the aging process?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Somewhat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Would it be beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) But, I thought you guys said I had another baby waiting to come in?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Does not necessarily mean will make it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, am I going through the change here?
      </p>

        A: Not yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) When will it start?

        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is S__ going to pay me the money she owes me?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What are the odds?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Depends on your efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does that mean that I have to now send her a certified letter through my attorney?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Up to you.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Will they pay on Monday?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And how much will the back pay be?

      </p>

      <p>
        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Back, a year or so ago, when we talked to Keith on the board, and you verified that it was Keith, Keith gave us a set of numbers that came in within 8 days of the day he gave them to us. Now, if he, as an earthbound spirit, was capable of giving us a set of numbers that came in within 10 days, could you not do the same?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Maybe, when all is well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In other words, when I am not in this crummy mood?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there any qualification that needs to be established for us to get the lottery numbers? Is there some thing we have to do, or be, or think, or say?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Completely pure intent, i.e. open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Completely open?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Nonanticipatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Our anticipation constricts the channel when we ask for that kind of information?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) We have to be completely uncaring whether we get it or not, so to speak?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Happy-go-lucky attitude helps. As you were before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, as long as we are worried, tense, anticipatory, and attached to the idea, we constrict the flow?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, you said in an earlier session that you were making financial arrangements for us. Well, I am not putting any weight or pressure on that, but, does that have anything to do with M__ T__ and referrals for hypnosis?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Maybe. Don&#39;t be anticipatory. Faith, dear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Thank you and good night.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Good night.
      </p>
      <p>
