      <p>
        Q: (V) Well, what course do I need to contact... the police... what course of action do I need to take with this? This is fraud...

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) So this is in no way... this is not a threat to me financially or in the future legally wise... somebody...

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Are these FBI files that have to do with metaphysical and UFO business and what have you, are they more than just the government? Are they connected to...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Are you listening?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Am I listening? Of course I&#39;m listening.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: FBI tracks everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Okay, so just don&#39;t worry about it. (T) I can just imagine what my file looks like! (L) The computer systems are so advanced it is no trouble for them to even know what color toilet paper you buy. (Laughter) I mean, the checker at the store tells what color toilet paper you buy on your receipt... &#34;Scottissue:blue&#34;...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: V prefers green.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do you prefer Green? (V) Yes, but I have white. (V) Are you telling me I&#39;m supposed to use green toilet paper? (T) They are perfecting 3rd level humor at 4th level. (laughter)
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Joke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) You&#39;re getting good at it too! (DM) I&#39;d like to know what they look like. (L) Did you read the transcripts? We already asked that. (DM) No, I haven&#39;t gotten to it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: We are light beings, we are you in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Susanne K. talked to me about Al Bielek. Previously you had said that Al was an agent of the government disseminating disinformation for one thing, number two: that he knew that he was an agent of the government; there&#39;s a little confusion about his participation in the Philadelphia Project; I found a reference to him in an Ivan Sanderson book published some time ago. Susanne says that this poor guy just lives from hand to mouth, and she finds it hard to believe that he is an agent of the government since he lives such a poverty stricken existence. Could you comment, please, on Al Bielek and his activities. (T) Is Al an agent for the government?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Al Bielek is many faceted. Poverty is subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is he an agent for the government. (T) They say he is many faceted.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes. But he is in involved in activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) In one session you talked about Al Bielek you indicated he was, um, not actually involved in the Philadelphia Experiment, that he was a technician on shore, and that he is now feeding out information that is provided to him, or that he had knowledge above and beyond his involvement with the experiment...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Okay, if he is working partly with the government and then partly for his own purposes, what is it that he expects to get out of this?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) What does he want from the exposure?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: He wants people to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it possible that he is giving out some true information along with disinformation, so that the information itself can be gotten out, could it be that his intentions might be...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Confused thought pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is that my thoughts or Al&#39;s thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Bingo! Laura&#39;s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Does Al know that he is giving out false information... does he know that the information the government is giving him is false?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: He is so involved you would not believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) He is involved with the government cover-up?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: With all of it. He knows that what he is saying is false but he has no choice because he is entangled in the web. They are using him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Ask about this letter Susanne sent from some source that states that Jesus was a mythical character.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No, Jesus was not mythical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) What about this information from this Acharya?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Babble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is the point of this stuff? It is very well done. Why are they trying to prove that Jesus never existed?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Nonsense. It is disinformation. Desinformatzia. Russki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) This is from Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No, we were having some fun with words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Mirth! Mirth! (T) Are any of the people they are copying this to believing this stuff?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Some.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Is UFO Library going to print this?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Well, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it is in there next month.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: There is a lot of garbage in there each month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, this is on a different subject, but, has M ever been abducted by aliens?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes, starting at age three. Do you remember &#34;ghost at corner window&#34; at 3 yrs old?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) I remember something very vaguely. I think I told Frank the story. Something happened and I think I woke up screaming. I saw something. When was the last time?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: At age 22.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) How many times has M been abducted?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: 23 times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) Will I be abducted again?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) When?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: It depends on belief center.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I think it might depend on how much knowledge you acquire as to whether you will be abducted again or under what circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Grandfather let you in on secrets of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) Yes, yes. He taught me a lot and I think that&#39;s what they mean.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: He was a &#34;Priority One Soul.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is a Priority One Soul?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: One who sacrifices life&#39;s pleasures to teach others. He was your teacher. You are lucky, M. He kept you from &#34;trouble.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who abducted M?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Grays.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What was the purpose of M&#39;s abduction?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: To study his mind. He has a very strong mind and resolve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Did they put an implant in him?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And what do they do with that implant?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Is monitor. Frequent ringing in ear signifies monitoring activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Frank) Do you have frequent ringing in your ear? (M) Yes. (L) One ear more than another? (M) Yes. It is kind of a tone. (T) Last session when I was here you were giving us information on how to calculate when the wave is going to reach Earth. I was able to plot two of the four for distance, but two were constellations. I cannot plot those distances.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Check third most distant star in Cassiopaea and middle &#34;belt&#34; star in Orion, closest star in Leo. Welcome M to the board.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) Well, just tell me what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Hi, M. We are glad to have you here with us tonight. We have been trying to reach you for 18 years as you measure time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You are destined just like the others and you know it inside. We have gone to great lengths to reach you. That is why you were brought together with Frank. Do you not remember feeling different back then?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) What does that mean? (V) Well, when you met Frank did you feel different? (M) Yes, I guess so. (L) Anybody who meets Frank feel different! (M) Amen! Thank you! (J) I would like to point out that we have all male energy on the board. That is different!
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You and Terry knew each other in last life, remember?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) Well, no, I don&#39;t. (V) You would probably remember if you would start meditating. (L) You could have past life regressions. (T) He wasn&#39;t that guy that got me with the sword when I was in the British Navy, was he? Those cutthroats?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No, but on same ship! This is why you returned to England!
      </p>
