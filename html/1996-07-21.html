      <p>
        I had been keeping Terry and Jan informed about the sessions and other developments and after Ark’s arrival on the virtual scene, their interest was revived to a certain extent. (They had also indicated that their channeling experiment with Andrew B was going nowhere.) However, they (and Frank) spent something like 6 hours repeating to me that Ark must be an agent and I had to be very careful. I appreciated their concern and decided that maybe we ought to ask a few questions along that line. However, the Cs were having none of that! It was almost comical that I was trying to get a hint and they were determined to give nothing at all on this topic. As later events proved, it’s obvious in retrospect why: some things are predestined events and must be entered into and managed entirely on one’s own. Also, there was the fact that they had been giving me clues all along but because I had been so depressed, I had not kept up with transcribing the sessions and could not review them so as to see those hints. Obviously, the &#34;fatal mistake&#34; referenced below would have been to listen to Terry, Jan and Frank in respect of Ark.

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I know you are not going to give me a roadmap, but you can give me a hint! What are the extent of the hints you can give me about this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: One and only hint: always transcribe and review material from the sessions if you wish to learn properly, and avoid possibly fatal mistakes!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, that is the one and only hint. I will start back on the transcribing.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) How do you enhance pondering?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, then I will just do them as I go along, is that what you mean?
      </p>
