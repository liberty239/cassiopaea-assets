      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Cassiopaea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I would like to ask who was with us last Saturday night, was it one of the Cassiopaeans or were we pulling in some corruption?

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, obviously since we don&#39;t want that kind of thing to happen anymore, the choice is already made. Okay, I would like to know, recently I watched a video at Jiles Hamilton&#39;s on psychic surgery. This, obviously, was the real thing. Am I correct in that assessment? {The video was made and presented by Henry Belk.}

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Simian mutation.

      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, on planet Earth.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Including Neanderthal?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) No, we&#39;ll just pass that up.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Okay, then it is 79 in broken sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Broken by what?
      </p>

      </p>

        Q: (L) How many for SV? Same?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

        Q: (L) What would be correct for her?
      </p>

      <p>
        Q: (L) SV is a 5th level soul?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. Spent 4 sequence hold overs there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now this is curious. Why do Frank and I have these 79 lives in the exact same sequence? Isn&#39;t that a little odd?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) How many lifetimes have the three of us in this room worked together?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is the significance of this relating to their religion and their experiences and the current state of the Jews?

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, I would also like to know: last January we had a lot of booming sounds which were reported to the local sheriff&#39;s office. The papers reported that they were military planes on maneuvers. Is this correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) We would like to have this project bring income so that we can devote more of our time to it. Is it going to become self-supporting?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Eventually, yes, but immediately no, because of veil of skepticism combined with relentless 4th density level originating attacks. Beware of those who profess great interest; agents of STS are preparing many false guides, as you have already seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What can we do to protect ourselves from this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Suggestion: &#34;Buttonhole&#34; in point blank fashion those who promise assistance or interest in indefinite way!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What does that mean?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Good question; when someone greets you at a function and gets your hopes up regarding helping you to further this most important work, demand immediate proof regarding their sincerity and credibility!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And if they don&#39;t prove their credibility and sincerity?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Drop them at once!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In other words, don&#39;t waste our time with deadbeats?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Or agents with ill intentions, either conscious or unconscious, don&#39;t be afraid to confront directly immediately and openly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Frank) If somebody comes up and says to us: &#34;I can do this or that for you&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m interested&#34; or whatever, we must tell them right off the bat that it is very nice that they are interested, but they must understand that we are under attack because of our work, so we have to know that they are serious and honest and good intentioned. (L) So, how do we get them to prove their sincerity? (SV) Get out the checkbook! (L) Is that it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Well, that can take many forms, but awhile ago, you asked about financial assistance, so why not say &#34;put your money where your mouth is,&#34; or something akin to that?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, that&#39;s it for the night. Thank you very much for being with us.
