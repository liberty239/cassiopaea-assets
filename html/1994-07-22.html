        End of Session
      </p>
      <p>
        [1] Candy was having a snack.
      </p>
      <p>
        [2] Another unusual name; I was intrigued.
      </p>
      <p>
        [3] I was making an assumption that we had been conversing with &#34;aliens.&#34; In fact, the Cassiopaeans have never described themselves as &#34;aliens.&#34; What they had actually said was &#34;alien from your perspective.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        [4] The curious thing about this remark is that on February 25 of 1995, we were given a warning of a terrorist bomb attack within a month. Connecting that back to this mention of Oklahoma &#34;political abduction,&#34; and we find a curious relationship to the Oklahoma Bombing in March of 1995. In one of the earliest reports of the capture of Timothy McVeigh, he was quoted as saying that he was under the control of an implant that was in his hip, and that he believed he had been abducted and programmed by the government. And it was, indeed, BIG news!
      </p>
      <p>
        [5] Keep this in mind also, along with the &#34;Sun in Libra&#34; remark from the first session, and the &#34;twin sun&#34; reference from the &#34;Carcosa&#34; clue.
      </p>
      <p>
        [6] We tried it and it was nonsense. We concluded that this was an attempt at side-tracking the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        [7] There were many rumors on the internet at the time of the Comet Shoemaker-Levy impacts on Jupiter that this comet had been meant to hit Earth, but a certain group of aliens, and I don&#39;t remember which one, had decided to &#34;save&#34; the Earth by redirecting these comets to strike Jupiter instead. Naturally, all of mankind was supposed to be grateful to this particular group for saving our buns from the fire!
      </p>
      <p>
        [8] I had recently read Zecharia Sitchin&#39;s  The 12th Planet  , which posits that a superior race of alien beings once inhabited our world. Sitchin claims that they were travelers from the stars, that they arrived eons ago, and genetically engineered mankind to be slaves for them. He claims that the &#34;Sons of Anak&#34; mentioned in the Bible are the Annunaki, and also that they are the same as the Nefilim mentioned in the Bible. His claim is that they are a race of gold-seeking giants from a renegade planet in our own solar system that was known to the Sumerians as the &#34;Planet of the Crossing.&#34; This planet &#34;crosses&#34; the plane of the ecliptic every 3,600 years, and when it gets close enough, these beings make a &#34;hop&#34; to Earth to check up on their creation. Supposedly, this will happen again soon. The title comes from the fact that Sitchin proposes that there are 12 houses of the zodiac because there were 12 &#34;planets.&#34; He includes the Sun and moon in his count because they are zodiacally significant. But, in actuality, it is really a 10th planet, excluding the Sun and Moon. He also fails to note that the Earth is excluded from zodiacal considerations due to the fact that astrology is geocentric. But that is a minor point. More significantly, there does seem to be something to the idea of a 3,600 year &#34;event&#34; of comet swarms due to the break-up of a giant comet as described by astronomers Victor Clube and Bill Napier in their books  The Cosmic Serpent  and  The Cosmic Winter  . This idea was given additional support by Firestone, West and Warwick-Smith in  The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes  . I am not aware of any other channeled source that has brought up and discussed these ideas and added information to the pool that later turned out to be correct based on scientific assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
        [9] This was proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky as an explanation for why the ancient astronomers and myth makers claimed that Venus was born from Jupiter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#34;Several times during the 15th and 8th centuries BC, the Earth was convulsed by near collisions with other celestial bodies. These cosmic brushes caused a series of catastrophes that altered the course of ancient history.&#34; A host of ancient myths and legends offer clues as to what happened during these catastrophes. Further written evidence is contained in the Old Testament Book of Exodus and also historical and astronomical texts inscribed on papyrus and on stone and clay tablets.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#34;Millennia after being ejected from Jupiter, the cometary Venus was thrown into an elliptical orbit around the sun. Along that orbit, it intersected the orbit of the Earth. Mankind watched in terror, as the sky seemed to catch fire. The Babylonians called Venus the &#34;bright torch of Heaven.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        &#34;The Chinese wrote that Venus spanned the heavens, rivaling the sun in Brightness. An ancient rabbinical record said that Venus &#34;Blazes from one end of the cosmos to the other.&#34;&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Velikovsky theorized by following the trail of Venus through world-wide myths and legends, that Venus intersected the Earth in its orbit sometime during the middle of the fifteenth century BC. This event was recorded in the Bible as the plagues of Egypt and the means by which the Jews escaped from bondage. Searching for verification of his theory, Velikovsky spent weeks trying to find an Egyptian account of the events of the Exodus. Finally he discovered a translation of an Egyptian papyrus which contained a description of a great catastrophe including the plagues of Egypt. It was called  Admonitions of a Sage  , or the
      </p>
      Ipuwer Papyrus  .
      <p>
        The reader will most certainly wish to read  Worlds in Collision  because it is one of the most rational books ever written. Even if Velikovsky was wrong about some of the conclusions he drew regarding myth and legend, his observations and proposals of a new way at looking at the cosmos have yet to be fully appreciated. And, according to the Cassiopaeans, he was, at least, partly correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        [10] Again, we are being urged to &#34;use the computer&#34; or a form of &#34;automatic writing&#34; for channeling purposes. Yes, it would certainly have been easier and faster, but I did not feel that the contact had been sufficiently checked out to warrant taking that step yet. One thing that occurs to me long after the fact is that this was a conflation of the idea of channeling with networking via computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        [11] This reference proved later to be the name of a planet. The question that occurs here is: Are planets also beings as is suggested by this reference to &#34;ancient wars?&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        [12] Zindar or Zendar also turned out to be a planetary name.
      </p>
      <p>
        [13] Again the computer is being suggested, only this time it is specifically addressed at me. But, I wasn&#39;t buying it. Not yet, at least. Later, however, I felt that a lot of &#34;The Wave&#34; was written in a &#34;special state&#34;.
