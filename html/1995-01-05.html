        A: 1800&#39;s..
      </p>

        A: Open.

        Q: (L) I sent out a batch of mail today, I sent a copy to M__ F__ with a cover letter etc. I am curious as to whether this will open his eyes in any way to the fact that what is going on with us is far more interesting than what is going on with Scarlett?

      <p>
        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are you going to give me any indication about how any of these people are going to react to any of this information? Can you look into the future and give me any idea of what I can expect from the different people?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Wait and see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) As far as I can see, having found out about the network, until I can get an access line, it seems that our use of this network is going to be severely limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Look into 800 number.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, in order to get an 800 number, I would have to get the company to do it. I&#39;ll look into it, but I don&#39;t think so. Now, this person on the network, IrishSir, I have basically decided that I am not going to respond to him because he is very offensive in his responses. It is as though he is attempting to draw me into a situation where he can attack. Is this course of action acceptable?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>

        A: Upper level wind convergence.

      <p>
        Q: (L) In other words, can these upper level winds and strange cloud patterns be 4th, 5th or 6th density interactions?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Could these cloud patterns be a result of strange electromagnetic patterns on the earth such as those that presage earthquakes and volcanic eruptions?
