      This is the session that introduces the topic of mind-programming, discusses the Greenbaum-type programming so after a slow start on personal topics, it gets quite interesting. I&#39;ll give a lot more details about it in the print version which is in preparation.

        Q: (L) Hello
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Hello
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who do we have with us this evening?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And where are you from?

        Q: (L) Does anybody want to start with some questions? Do we have an open forum tonight, seeing as there are no questions?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You always have an open forum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, seeing as how we have no specific questions, I will ask this question. I was talking with Roger Santilli, and he has expressed his opinion that the potential opportunities for doing research in the United States are extremely limited. I would like to know if that&#39;s necessarily...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Wrong!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Good! I&#39;m glad it&#39;s wrong! If it is wrong, can you tell us precisely in what way it is wrong, and how we can look at it to gain a better perspective.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: There are no limits, just controls... The knowledge gives one all the necessary tools to overcome the controls. Do not attempt to formulate words as you write, my dear. Just &#34;Go with the flow&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I&#39;m feeling pretty darn warm, the energy is higher than I&#39;ve seen it in a long time... (T) Energetic little being, isn&#39;t he?!

      <p>
        Q: (L) The energy is really good. I like it. OK, guys, we like the energy tonight. Tell us why we have such good energy tonight.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Tom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And what is there about Tom?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not often here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Anything else about it? No. All right, Marcie took a particular type of Reiki initiation or attunement today, and I&#39;d like to know, what was the... she had an event occur during the attunements. I would like to know what this event was. What this condition was that she experienced.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: She should be careful not to &#34;spread her self too thin.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And what does that mean?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: One does not need to cram learning, &#34;steady as she goes.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) They&#39;re punctually correct, aren&#39;t they? (L) Yes, they are! So, is that in a sense a caution? {V was referring to punctuation, not punctuality.}
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Can you describe what it was that was taking place with her? Or define it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Soul bilocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, it was not exactly a state, as the Sufis describe?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And where did she bi-locate to?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not easily explainable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Was it to another density or dimension? Or parallel universe or spiritual domain? (T) Norfolk Naval Station? [Laughter] Destination of bilocation! (L) Was this a beneficial event for her?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. She has been ripping open the fabric too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Do you know what that means? (TM) The fabric of this dimension? (L) Is T correct? The fabric of this dimension?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close. Each soul has its own patterning, which is held in place by the three bodies of existence [planchette swirls a few times] ... &#34;thought center, spirit center and physical center,&#34; there are specific methodologies for adjusting these, and travelling into or out of other planes of existence. When one does not properly utilize these, one tears the fabric of their trilateral continuum when they seek to travel. This can be very problematic, and may lead to the soul being unable to reconnect with the body, thus causing the physical center to perish!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) The man who was giving the attunements, was he aware of what was happening, or what he was doing?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Aware only of unusual sensates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) He did this? You let him touch you? (M) Yes. (L) Oh, Jesus! (M) Sensations, that&#39;s what he said. He was aware of it, he just didn&#39;t know what it was. (T) He felt it, but he had no idea what was going on. (M) He just felt that it was something to do with the attunement. I guess, I mean, I don&#39;t know! (L) Did it have anything to do with the attunement?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. It had to do with previous experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Why did she see like a past life review?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You described it well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In other words, when I said that when she separated from her body, she was able to access the past life review, just as if you were in the process of dying. (M) Well, experiments by who? (L) You!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) The initiation stimulated the spirit center. (M) So, what would they have me do? (L) Well, they aren&#39;t going to tell you that! (M) No? (L) You have to make your own mind... (M) What&#39;s the proper way to go through these.. If I&#39;m tearing my fabric, how do I not tear my fabric? (L) Slow down?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: By ceasing until it is properly healed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) You&#39;ve got to be healed. (M) Healed of what? (T) Healed at the rips and tears? (L) Well, maybe more than that...

        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) The portal you have in your house? (M) I&#39;ve got it in my aura, we&#39;ve seen it on film. (L) Maybe that&#39;s part of the tear?(M) I don&#39;t know... (TM) Look at the location of it... (M) It sure is huge, and it sure is...
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

(T) I&#39;m still waiting to see the photograph of the board. (L) I sent it to Ark. (T) Awwww, I&#39;m never going to see the photograph of the board!!! (L) No, no, no! Cherie has a copy of it. She&#39;s going to make us an enlargement. (M) So, what am I supposed to do with this, can the portal assist in any way, this thing in the aura, will it do me any good, I mean, what&#39;s it for, anyway?...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) Well, that&#39;s just wonderful!!! How did it get there? (TM) Somebody did something bad there? (M) The top of my head? (TM) Now, wait a minute, it&#39;s in your aura? (M) Yes, it&#39;s on the top of my head, it comes right down. (TM) Ohhh!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No it is not a part of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) OK, so it just kind of likes to hang out in my aura! Loves photographing my aura. It loves to be there, we don&#39;t know what it is. (T) Maybe it jumps in your aura because it&#39;s photogenic! (V) Can it be resolved with spirit release? (L) No. Any personal advice for her at this point?

      <p class="answer">
        A: Consolidate classes into three way study groupings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is a three way study group?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Combined study of three subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) All right, combine the study of three subjects, instead of studying them separately. So, what subjects are you teaching? (M) I teach healing, I teach the rays of initiation, and I teach auras. (L) Well I guess they are saying to teach all three of them together! Have them all assemble at the same time, instead of separately. (M) The only one I don&#39;t do, that&#39;s really combined, I teach about healing and auras, but the other one, the one about rays of initiations, that is a separate class. It doesn&#39;t fit in! (L) Well, see if you can work a way to do it, like, an hour on this subject, and then we&#39;ll go on to this subject. Like a two-class school. And now we go to this, and do it all in one fell swoop, and that way, you&#39;ve got about two hours. All right, anything else for her? (T) How about asking where this portal came from? (L) Yes, what was the generative source? The one in her house.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: More than one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) OK, there&#39;s more than one generative source. So, it&#39;s a combination of factors. Is it part of the historical site? The space-time location?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it part of the metaphysical activities taking part in the house itself?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it part M herself? And her own mental states?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Other occupants. More than her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) Do they mean live ones or dead ones?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (M) That&#39;s what I thought. (V) How can it be removed? (L) What would be the best technique for her stopping activity and allowing herself to heal, and getting herself on track so that she doesn&#39;t get any real... Jesus, can you imagine, if this kind of happened again, and you just checked out ?And couldn&#39;t get back?

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We would like to have the opportunity to discuss other issues at this session besides personal issues, as this drains the channel energy. But, we will accept limited questions from those in particular need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I want to finish for her. Can I ask just one short, maybe a couple added to it; quick ones for Marcie?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: One, please.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) The question I have is, she is in a situation where she is somewhat obfuscated in her directions. It seems that many sorts of sources seek to...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Obfuscation is illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I know, but what I&#39;m trying to get at for my question is yes, she&#39;s got all these illusions that she gets thrown at her. But, it seems to me that a person who gets this much attack...

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (TM) Thank you, that&#39;s all I wanted to know. (L) Well you should have asked it in a different way! I thought you were going to ask a mechanical question! [Laughter] It&#39;s been done! I did it!!!! Remember, we asked about LM&#39;s truck, and he wanted to argue about it, and the next day, found out it was absolutely correct! He argued with them!!! They diagnosed the problem with his truck, and he argued with them; ‘Well they don&#39;t know anything about mechanics!&#39; He stomped around and everything. The next day, the guy from across the street comes over and looks at it and says exactly the same thing they did! That&#39;s all it needed, just a little rubber thing stuck over a hole. [Laughter] Did he believe? No! It didn&#39;t matter to him! OK, I do have one question here. I talked to Chloe the other day, and I told her what we got the other night, about {her recently deceased husband} being sleeping, and she wanted to say that she just couldn&#39;t accept that, because so many other people have had visitations and visions and dreams and so forth of him wandering around and doing all these good deeds in the other world. Comments, please.
      </p>

        A: Not true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) It&#39;s not true. Then why are all these other people saying that they are seeing TomG or having experiences with him, either in dreams or visual, or whatever, and what are these people seeing and experiencing?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: In short, inflated opinions of ability manifest false reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, these various people who think they&#39;re psychic have such inflated opinions of their own abilities that they are all calling her up and saying ‘I saw him, he spoke to me... he came to me in a dream...&#39; (M) Who is TomG?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, I think I should just not say anything further about it. I was trying to say it in a more comforting way, but she, I guess, what is it...

We are all here, at all times, to help you when you need it. So, therefore, you have advice, you have been promised a miracle, it may have something to do with a phone conversation I had the other day... (M) Yes, that was weird! (L) Now, carry on! (T) Was there something you wanted to speak on this evening? You said there were other issues that you wanted to talk about.

      <p>
        Q: (V) Jesus! (L) Well, in her subconscious mind wanderings, was she picking up something in the atmosphere; some thought, or some fear? (V) I can&#39;t believe that that would come from me!

      <p class="answer">
        A: No. Why would you say prophecy?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, she was concerned that it was something that could happen... (V) No, I wasn&#39;t concerned in that way... I&#39;m concerned, I&#39;m disgusted by it, and I would be much easier for me to handle if it was some kind of past life memory than if it were something that comes from my psyche. Because it disgusts me.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Disgust manifested in dream state wanderings always result from repressed situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Ohhh, I see! Was that something that was in the air and was... (V) Repressed as in my relationship with the person.

      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      <p class="answer">
        A: Think of the persons who have inexplicably entered various public and private domains, and shot large numbers of people... Now, you have &#34;met&#34; some of these Greenbaum subjects...
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Let me say this. If this is what we&#39;re saying, well, what I&#39;m saying is, that ... Is this Greenbaum programming something that goes along the line of what I&#39;ve just described a part; a part, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s all of it...

      <p class="answer">
        A: Now, some history... as you know, the CIA and NSA and other agencies are the children of Nazi Gestapo... the SS, which was experiment influenced by Antareans who were practicing for the eventual reintroduction of the Nephalim on to 3rd and or 4th density earth. And the contact with the &#34;Antareans&#34; was initiated by the Thule Society, which groomed its dupe subject, Adolph Hitler to be the all time mind programmed figurehead. Now, in modern times, you have seen, but so far, on a lesser scale: Oswald, Ruby, Demorenschildt, Sirhan Sirhan, James Earl Ray, Arthur Bremer, Farakahan, Menendez, Bundy, Ramirez, Dahmer, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there any particular individual who is currently being programmed to take a more prominent position in terms of this...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Later... you must know that Oswald was programmed to be the &#34;patsy.&#34; So that he would say many contradictory things. Demorenschildt was both a programmer and programmed. Ruby was hypnotically programmed to shoot Oswald with an audio prompt, that being the sound of a car horn.
