        Frank, Laura
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Who do we have this evening?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yopanno.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: And where are you transmitting from?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Cassiopaea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Am I on the right track with the &#34;bloodline&#34; research?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Am I going to discover some more startling things with this &#34;bloodline&#34; research?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Discovery is the fruit of inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Am I correct in my assessment that the origin of the Grail stories was the story of the Head of Bran?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: But what was the &#34;origin&#34; of Brahna?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, from the way I am interpreting what I have found, I have two possibilities: One is the Celts from Kantek, and two: a Nephilim hybrid.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Could be one and the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, from what you have said in prior sessions, these bloodlines can be of positive or negative orientation, a duality, and that they lead to super-secret power sources. Is that correct?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Well, the duality is existent concommitantly through all bloodlines, but in the so-called celts, it is more pronounced, therefore, there are more vivid power cells and centers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Are these cells and centers that you talk about, are they something that is located in the body or a part of the spirit-body connection...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: The extant body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What do you mean by &#34;extant&#34; body?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Existent/external.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Okay, I will keep digging. How can I find if there is going to be a connection between the Aryan/Jewish bloodline of Jesus and the Merovingian/Plantagenet bloodline? Does it exist?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Only to the extent of the shared origins of the essenes and the celts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: A mentioned that he used to think that he was Jewish. Is he, or half?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: If you are going to find anything, you need not be foretold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Am I going to find anything?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Just do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I did a little card reading while he was going to see his daughter for the first time in almost 6 months, and I pulled up one card that said &#34;sickness unto death.&#34; And, I had asked what would be the result on me of this meeting with his daughter, and this is what it said. I was very upset because I had the dream about dying when I was up in Gainesville. Can you tell me anything? I was upset!
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Cards mean only what the vibrations provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Were my vibrations that I was going to get sick and die, or that our relationship was going to get sick and die, the daughter was going to be sick and die, or A or A or...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Every physical vehicle experiences &#34;sickness unto death.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: My question was: what would be the result of this meeting with his daughter. Now, you are worrying me.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Why worry? Do you not see that which you have accomplished up to now, through desire begetting sheer will, begetting realization?!?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Could I have been picking up vibrations of A having someone put some sort of hex on me?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: What difference does it make?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, once before when someone did this, you said I was sick because these dark forces were concentrated on me.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: What is our most famous saying?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Knowledge protects.... Well, does having knowledge of her nature provide protection?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You are not realizing your power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: So, I don&#39;t even need that?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No,
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Okay. Now, I thought about it and reasoned it out, and am nearly positive that she took the pictures, tape and Brana letters. The pictures I can understand. Either to spite me or him, or to use in a negative way. Or is there another option? I am not seeking confirmation, just trying to settle it so I can get away from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Then it is settled, so go away from it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, what I am really trying to get to is this: some of those pictures were irreplaceable. I would like to recover them. Can you suggest something?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Let the pieces fall into place.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Is it important for me to go to Europe in any way? To do anything significant?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Is there any significant reason to go other than to be with him?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I need a word of wisdom. A clue to follow....
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Blue water, white skies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What does that mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You asked for a clue!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Oh! Okay. Thanks and good night.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Good night.
