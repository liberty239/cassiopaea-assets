        Frank, Laura

      <p>
        Q: I have a number of questions that I want to get into tonight. Frank and I have been discussing the nature of attack. The first thing I would like to ask is: I did a hypnosis session with MM and utilized some of the Greenbaum techniques. She responded in the affirmative. I was told that she had several alter personalities: &#34;masterprogrammer, gatekeeper, Alpha, Beta, Theta and Delta, zero,&#34; and that there were over 3,000 installed programs. Were these responses valid?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Validity is subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Does MM have over 3,000 of these &#34;programs?&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Be careful of data which originates from sources which mislead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Which is the misleading source?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: May mislead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Which is misleading: MM or the Greenbaum text?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No its the center of origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: That which I perceive as a negative attachment?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: This &#34;subject&#34; appears to be fragmented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: So, MM is suffering from MPD?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Not that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Are her fragments caused by abductions?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: She has had abductions and the like, but not the issue here. She is &#34;searching,&#34; and when one is searching...

        Session interrupted by long distance phone call and never resumed.
