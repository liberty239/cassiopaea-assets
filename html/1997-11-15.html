      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Hello.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: And who do we have with us this evening?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Wiappahn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: And where do you transmit through?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Cassiopaea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I guess you have been listening to our discussion, so let&#39;s dispose of the burning question at the moment: is it safe at the present time for us to travel to Mexico?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: More specific data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: We are invited for a conference from November 30th to December 5th. But, the idea was to stay for two weeks. The conference is not in Mexico City, but when we come back, we will probably come through there.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Ciudad de Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, essentially, that is all we know. We know we will be flying American Airlines, but we don&#39;t know the flight number yet.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: When you ask: &#34;is it safe,&#34; the very nature of the question is vague.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I understand. More to the point, I am concerned about being gone so long from the children; will things be safe here at the house, how can I minimize the risks HERE?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Take two with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Which two?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Which do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Arielle and Amy would be the ones I would take, I should think.

        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Amy would be safe at home?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: She is more durable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: We had already decided we would not go because of the safety issue where the children are concerned, but there is a new issue that has arisen in the past few days... the idea that Ark might be able to get a Mexican divorce while we are there. Is it possible, considering all the things that Fernando had to say on the subject, that we COULD go there and get the divorce?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Of course! And marriage too, if you wish. Remember, ceremonies can be held any time. Legalities must be addressed &#34;when opportunity knocks.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) I am not aware that he was working in this direction. He was more experimental than theoretical, but he was collaborating with other guys. In particular, I would like to know if this Pappas knows the same as Marinov did?

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: The problem is that these scientists are often too eager to share and reveal. Remember: it is most difficult to win a Nobel Prize when one&#39;s residence is a tomb.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Is it true that there was a luminous spot on the pavement where Marinov died?

        Q: What was this substance? And what was it used for?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Phosphorescent Sulphate Ammonia Chloride. Ammonium Chloride with correct formulation, can be injected intravascularly in order to induce a state of super-suggestibility when utilized in conjunction with pre-existent hypnotic programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Alright, a subject I hypnotized some years ago described being abducted, taken to an underground facility nearby, and having some sort of glowing green fluid introduced intravenously. Was this a similar substance?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I think that I remember something similar being described by Karla Turner.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Obviously, the residual on the sidewalk was there as a result of blunt trauma to the skull.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: He jumped because of the programming and the blunt trauma was the result of his head hitting the sidewalk...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Are these ideas, the programming that is carried on this way that is described here, that was described by Laura&#39;s subject, that is described in the Karla Turner book, and that is making something of a stir in other arenas, is this within the realm of the military abduction scenario, or covert operation abductions. Are these all related to human abductors rather than alien?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes, to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Yes, well S___ described her abductors as being military guys and NOT aliens... (T) Yes, and she was taken out there by Anclote to the little base....
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No coincidence, the former Stauffer Chemical plant nearby!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) There was another guy who was in contact with both Marinov and Pappas, and with whom I was also in contact, his name is A___, does he know essentially the same as Marinov?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: More...
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: He knows more... Why don&#39;t you guys just quit messing around and give us the UFT?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. Because, then somebody would kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Alright, then, I don&#39;t want to know! Sorry I asked!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You will discover on your own, when you are ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: In our own experiments with, ummm.... discovering ways and means of getting beneath the surface of what is going on here on the planet, are we headed in right direction and are we making progress?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Is there anything we could add to the process?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes, discover! Okay, &#34;time&#34; to go. Good Night!
