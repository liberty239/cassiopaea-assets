      December 3, 1994 Frank, Laura, V__
      <p>
        Q: Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who do we have with us tonight?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Wasanna.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) V__ had an incident at school where a small pile of powder appeared on her books after she had put her head down on them. What was this?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Materialized thoughts passed through frontal lobe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Well, that is just amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Amazement is fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) I would like to know the source of the tension between my mother and myself?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Maternal influences. Psychological anxiety. Mother daughter rivalry for male attention. Enough personal dilly dallys. Long message to follow. Pause: Ukraine explosion; chemical or nuclear. Hawaii crash; aviation, possibly involving military. More California seismic activity after 1st of year: San Diego, San Bernardino, North Bakersfield, Barstow: all are fracture points. Hollister, Palo Alto, Imperial, Ukiah, Eureka, Point Mendocino, Monterrey, Offshore San Luis Obispo, Capistrano, Carmel: these are all stress points of fracture in sequence. &#34;Time&#34; is indefinite. Expect gradual destruction of California economy as people begin mass exodus. Also, Shasta erupts; Lassen activity. Ocean floor begins to subside. Leave channel open and pause: Queen Elizabeth serious illness; blood related. Princess Diana suicide attempt. Gas explosions this winter in NE United States, Texas and other. Supernova and unusual weather all over. Memphis feels tremors. Minneapolis banking scandal relates to mysterious Nordic covenant. Evangelical sexual tryst exposed. Gold is discovered in California after one of the quakes. UFOs dramatic increase and Gulf Breeze gets swarmed, becomes massive &#34;Mecca&#34;. Laura sees much more UFO activity. Huge wave of UFO activity. All manner and origins. Just you wait, it will give you chills and that feeling in the pit of your stomach. Many aliens will appear and we will be visible too. Think of it as a convention. All must awaken to this. It is happening right now. The whole populace will play individual roles according to their individual frequencies. This is only the beginning. Just you wait &#34;Henry Higgins,&#34; just you wait!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are you a Rodgers and Hammerstein fan? {While “Rodgers and Hammerstein” is what I said, and the creators of “My Fair Lady” were actually Lerner and Loew, the general intent of the question was “musical comedy”.}
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) How do you relate to the Pleiadians?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Pleiadians are communicating with many others; we are bursting upon the scene with you, but we are essentially the same, just at slightly different focus points on the realm border.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, why is all this activity happening now?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: The grand cycle is about to close presenting a unique opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this mean that this is a unique opportunity to change the future?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Future, past and present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, that sort of makes me think that if things are not changed somewhat at this point on the grand cycle that things could get really direfully screwed up, is that correct?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: But they won&#39;t. You have not grasped concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Yeah I have, I got you, I understand. It&#39;s just part of the cycle. It&#39;s all a cycle. I mean their being here is part of us being here...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You do??? {inscribed giant question mark on board}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do what?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You said you understood concept. Really? Learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, since you guys can do that {referring to the big question mark}, why can&#39;t you teach us power symbols that will enhance our Reiki?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You are not ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) But if we work on the Reiki will you teach us more power symbols?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Okay, we&#39;ll give you one. {draws symbol}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is this symbol called?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Anuki. Pronounced: AH - NEW - KEY.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) And, as it applies to Reiki, what does it do? What does it represent?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Retention of energy at location most in need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) So, if we work on somebody, do we use the symbol at the beginning or at the end?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: All Reiki you have as yet learned involves passage of healing energy, this one involves prolonged retention for strengthened power, thus results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Where are you getting this from?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Access is Universal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Did Dr. Usui also receive this and then not remember it?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Usui did not reveal all to Takata.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: He was told that the knowledge was priceless and must not be wasted by too much dissemination particularly to those who do not have the burning desire for truth. Those who did, as you do, would find some way of accessing knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Are we also advised not to divulge this information?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: As always, be discreet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is this something we should pass to ______ and ______ {referencing two local Reiki practitioners of our acquaintance}.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it necessary to line the points up and the ascending line with geometric precision?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And then, the circle elongated or more a perfect circle?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: {Demonstration of drawing of circle part of symbol}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Has there ever been a crop circle that looks like this? It looks like one I saw.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Precisely. All are interrelated
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it true that crop circles are a kind of grand Reiki being given to the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: But also messages and lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Laura) Well, could it also be said that Reiki symbols as applied to the body are etheric messages to the etheric body?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do they communicate information into our field, so to speak?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Everything that exists at all levels is just lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, in the case of Reiki, what I specifically want to know is if, say an individual is psychically, spiritually, karmically, or otherwise wounded or discombobulated, does the application of Reiki symbols give messages to the electromagnetic field to re-form or re-arrange the pattern in the perfect pattern intended?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And can repeated application of this, can not only physical things, but also etheric things, be healed? That is karma and so forth?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So that our continual use of Reiki and application to ourselves and each other literally would cleanse us from our karmic burdens, memories or scars of the soul?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) I am just concerned about the previously mentioned &#34;convention&#34;...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Convention is because of realm border crossing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And why is there a convention attending this realm border crossing? I mean, is it just a &#34;reely big shew!&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        A: It is an opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) As in the windows are all opening at one time so that all these beings can get in at one time?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: As in an opportunity to affect whole universe. Picture cosmic playing of &#34;Pomp and Circumstance&#34; AKA &#34;Hope and Glory.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Laura) How can a convention with slews of different kinds and races of people, converging on a single little pin- point planet on the outer edges of an insignificant galaxy, at the farthest reaches of this enormous universe, affect the whole thing?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: That is your perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, what is the correct perception? Is the planet earth and the people thereon, and the things that are going on in this spot, the earth specifically, more important than maybe we would ordinarily have thought?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: The Earth is a Convergence point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Has it always been a convergence point? Was it designed to be a convergence point? Or, is it just going to be a convergence point this once?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Too many questions at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Was it designed to be a convergence point from the beginning?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Natural function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Has it been a convergence point all along? Is that why so many weird things happen here?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: That is difficult to answer because you have no understanding of &#34;time&#34;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Has this type of convention thing happened on other planets with other groups of beings?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Has, is, and will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Laura) So, in other words, there are other planets, I don&#39;t mean similar in structure or occupation, but other planets that are convergence points?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Are they parallel universes?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Drifting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) If these convergence points are scattered around the universe, is the convergence of this realm border crossing going to occur simultaneously at all points in the universe that are convergence points?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) It only happens at say one, or selected, convergence points at any given point?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, do realm borders have something to do with location?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Realm borders ride waves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And where do these waves come from?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: They constantly cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does it have something to do with the movement of the planet earth into it or does it move onto us?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Either or.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (F) Does this convention or convergence have something to do with the fact that there are living beings on the earth?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes. And because you are at critical juncture in development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I would like to know in terms of prophecy if the prophecies you gave us in the first session are still valid and upcoming?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: They are evolving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does that mean that they are evolving to the point that they are going to happen soon?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Fluid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does that mean that some of them may not happen?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And the prophecies that you gave tonight, are they subject to change also?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are they more solid?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I would like to know who is communicating with Ken Carey. Who does he get this information from?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Many.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are these individuals &#34;good guys&#34; from our perspective?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes, some. Some is corrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is some of the information that comes through this channel corrupted?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Not as yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are the 6th density Orions, also known as Transient Passengers, are they the same TPs that have been referred to as the ones who genetically engineered us or put us here?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Close. They are Wave riders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are those groups that ride the wave, is riding the wave part of the definition of Transient Passengers?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do they like to ride this wave?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Is it &#34;fun&#34; for you to live on earth?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I like living on earth a great deal, but I don&#39;t like pain and suffering, and I don&#39;t like man&#39;s inhumanity to man and I don&#39;t like to see other people suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Do you live on earth for amusement?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I would like to live on Earth for amusement but I haven&#39;t had a whole heck of a lot of laughs since I have been here this time. I would like to have a life on the planet where things were pleasant...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You misunderstood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I see what you are saying. That&#39;s where they live because that&#39;s where they live.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (F) In other words, did you choose to live on Earth because you bought a ticket? (Laura) I got it, Frank. I do want to ask about the &#34;Course in Miracles&#34; that is supposed to be channelled by Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit. Is this true?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is the source that this is channelled from?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Variable sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are they good guys?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Some.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, even the &#34;Course in Miracles&#34; must be taken with a grain of salt?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I sent the answers to Karla, is this what she wanted?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes. She is diverted at the moment by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it possible to do hypnotic future progressions and get accurate responses?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In the book &#34;Mass Dreams of the Future,&#34; there are 4 scenarios described; are all of these scenarios accurate in terms of general experience?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Possible futures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, when a person does a future progression, they are seeing a possible future and not necessarily...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Depends on quality of channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, some people can be hypnotically progressed and get really accurate information?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I would like to know, in the description of the Pentecost, it was said that the disciples gathered in a room and prayed for days and days and suddenly a wind came rushing in and flames danced over their heads and they all began speaking in tongues. I would like to know if this event or something similar occurred?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In other words, the true baptism of the &#34;Holy Spirit&#34; was when Jesus breathed on his disciples and transmitted something like the Reiki initiation?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, I had an experience a number of years ago when I was in church, when it seemed to me that I was speaking in tongues. Was that, in fact, what happened to me?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) It was suggested to me and therefore that is what occurred?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Was any kind of psychic event occurring to me at that time?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who or what energy is behind Jacques Vallee, the great scientist, investigator and writer? Sometimes it seems like he is missing the point and sometimes it seems like he is the only one who knows what is going on.

      </p>
