      December 3, 1994 Frank, Laura, V__
      <p>
        Q: Hello.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who do we have with us tonight?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Wasanna.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) V__ had an incident at school where a small pile of powder appeared on her books after she had put her head down on them. What was this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Materialized thoughts passed through frontal lobe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Well, that is just amazing.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Amazement is fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) I would like to know the source of the tension between my mother and myself?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Maternal influences. Psychological anxiety. Mother daughter rivalry for male attention. Enough personal dilly dallys. Long message to follow. Pause: Ukraine explosion; chemical or nuclear. Hawaii crash; aviation, possibly involving military. More California seismic activity after 1st of year: San Diego, San Bernardino, North Bakersfield, Barstow: all are fracture points. Hollister, Palo Alto, Imperial, Ukiah, Eureka, Point Mendocino, Monterrey, Offshore San Luis Obispo, Capistrano, Carmel: these are all stress points of fracture in sequence. &#34;Time&#34; is indefinite. Expect gradual destruction of California economy as people begin mass exodus. Also, Shasta erupts; Lassen activity. Ocean floor begins to subside. Leave channel open and pause: Queen Elizabeth serious illness; blood related. Princess Diana suicide attempt. Gas explosions this winter in NE United States, Texas and other. Supernova and unusual weather all over. Memphis feels tremors. Minneapolis banking scandal relates to mysterious Nordic covenant. Evangelical sexual tryst exposed. Gold is discovered in California after one of the quakes. UFOs dramatic increase and Gulf Breeze gets swarmed, becomes massive &#34;Mecca&#34;. Laura sees much more UFO activity. Huge wave of UFO activity. All manner and origins. Just you wait, it will give you chills and that feeling in the pit of your stomach. Many aliens will appear and we will be visible too. Think of it as a convention. All must awaken to this. It is happening right now. The whole populace will play individual roles according to their individual frequencies. This is only the beginning. Just you wait &#34;Henry Higgins,&#34; just you wait!

        Q: (L) Are you a Rodgers and Hammerstein fan? {While “Rodgers and Hammerstein” is what I said, and the creators of “My Fair Lady” were actually Lerner and Loew, the general intent of the question was “musical comedy”.}

        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) How do you relate to the Pleiadians?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Pleiadians are communicating with many others; we are bursting upon the scene with you, but we are essentially the same, just at slightly different focus points on the realm border.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, why is all this activity happening now?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: The grand cycle is about to close presenting a unique opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this mean that this is a unique opportunity to change the future?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Future, past and present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, that sort of makes me think that if things are not changed somewhat at this point on the grand cycle that things could get really direfully screwed up, is that correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: But they won&#39;t. You have not grasped concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Yeah I have, I got you, I understand. It&#39;s just part of the cycle. It&#39;s all a cycle. I mean their being here is part of us being here...
      </p>

        A: You said you understood concept. Really? Learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, since you guys can do that {referring to the big question mark}, why can&#39;t you teach us power symbols that will enhance our Reiki?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are not ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) But if we work on the Reiki will you teach us more power symbols?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Okay, we&#39;ll give you one. {draws symbol}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is this symbol called?
      </p>

      <p>
        Q: (V) And, as it applies to Reiki, what does it do? What does it represent?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Retention of energy at location most in need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) So, if we work on somebody, do we use the symbol at the beginning or at the end?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: All Reiki you have as yet learned involves passage of healing energy, this one involves prolonged retention for strengthened power, thus results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Where are you getting this from?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Why?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: He was told that the knowledge was priceless and must not be wasted by too much dissemination particularly to those who do not have the burning desire for truth. Those who did, as you do, would find some way of accessing knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Are we also advised not to divulge this information?

      <p>
        Q: (Laura) Well, could it also be said that Reiki symbols as applied to the body are etheric messages to the etheric body?

      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, in the case of Reiki, what I specifically want to know is if, say an individual is psychically, spiritually, karmically, or otherwise wounded or discombobulated, does the application of Reiki symbols give messages to the electromagnetic field to re-form or re-arrange the pattern in the perfect pattern intended?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So that our continual use of Reiki and application to ourselves and each other literally would cleanse us from our karmic burdens, memories or scars of the soul?

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Convention is because of realm border crossing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And why is there a convention attending this realm border crossing? I mean, is it just a &#34;reely big shew!&#34;
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Laura) How can a convention with slews of different kinds and races of people, converging on a single little pin- point planet on the outer edges of an insignificant galaxy, at the farthest reaches of this enormous universe, affect the whole thing?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is your perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, what is the correct perception? Is the planet earth and the people thereon, and the things that are going on in this spot, the earth specifically, more important than maybe we would ordinarily have thought?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: The Earth is a Convergence point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Has it always been a convergence point? Was it designed to be a convergence point? Or, is it just going to be a convergence point this once?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Too many questions at once.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Natural function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Has it been a convergence point all along? Is that why so many weird things happen here?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is difficult to answer because you have no understanding of &#34;time&#34;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Has this type of convention thing happened on other planets with other groups of beings?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Has, is, and will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Laura) So, in other words, there are other planets, I don&#39;t mean similar in structure or occupation, but other planets that are convergence points?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Are they parallel universes?

      <p>
        Q: (L) And where do these waves come from?

      <p class="answer">
        A: They constantly cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does it have something to do with the movement of the planet earth into it or does it move onto us?

        A: Either or.
      </p>
      <p>
