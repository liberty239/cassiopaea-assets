        A: Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, when I do eat I eat salads and so forth, so I think I am alright. Now, last night I had a very strange experience where it seemed that I was out of the body and doing backflips. Was this an OOBE?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Now, Ark is having another hearing in the upcoming week {he was in Poland}and he has learned from his attorney that {his soon-to-be-ex} has consulted this woman attorney. But, he had the idea that she was delaying the hearing so that the dye would wear off her hair so she could create a dramatic effect... is this the case?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If so, who do you suppose will buy it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, nobody, I guess. Is this hearing going to make any progress in the case?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Progress is measured in various ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I know that, but I want to know a general time frame in which this will be accomplished.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Do you expect us to?

        Q: I would LIKE to have a CLUE! Maybe not a time frame, but a CLUE!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: It will not come faster if we tell you this. This is a good lesson for all involved. When completed, you will understand things much more clearly than you do now!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, okay. I would like to find out about my own case. I have NOT heard a word from this attorney. Is there anything I could do that I have NOT thought of?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Have you contacted them every three days?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: No, not every three days. I was waiting to see what they were gonna do. Are you suggesting I should contact them every three days?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: What happens to the proverbial squeaky wheel?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: In contacting them, what should be the approach: accusative, or what?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No &#34;what&#39;s the update guys?&#34; Simply presenting yourself often enough will make you far more valuable in the &#34;settlement bin.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not a good idea. Without legal assistance, you would be considered a &#34;suspect&#34; by the insurance company!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Okay. We have talked a little bit about the Gulf Breeze Conference THIS Spring being the one we are supposed to go to rather than the one last year... This time, of course, Ark would be with us...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Won&#39;t be that expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I had a dream the other night about {my ex}. When he was here to sign those papers the other day, he seemed to not even be connected to reality. Then I had a dream about him coming into the house and acting like a zombie and then walking up to a door and bashing his face against the door frame until it was bloody. This was so strange. I told Ark and he was concerned that {my ex} would go off the deep end. Can you tell me anything about this? What is the present condition of L?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We will just say, now would be a good &#34;time&#34; to be kind to {him}!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: When I am kind to him, he takes it the wrong way...

      <p class="answer">
        A: Were you not before?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Yes, I have been concerned on an ongoing basis. It seems that no matter what I do, he takes it the wrong way.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Adjust your methodology, and make intentions clear!
      </p>

      <p>
        Q: Is this brain injury something that is deteriorating?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Mother has a couple of questions. (Alice) Since you told me about the past life experience, and that all of my problems have been emotional, have all the mistakes that I have made been because that is what I INTENDED to do in this life?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Scrambled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Are you saying her question was scrambled, or that her life was scrambled?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) You straighten it. (L) No, you have to do it. That&#39;s part of the learning process. (A) Well, how was it scrambled? Were all the mistakes I have made in this life part of a plan?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. Mistakes are made by choice, plan is merely &#34;blueprint.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: So, she had a blueprint, and the mistakes were made by choice because she made the wrong choices?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, I think that what she is trying to deal with here is her guilt. She wants to know why she has lived her whole life making these mistakes and messing everything up every time she made a choice to do something?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Must be specific as to mistakes, always!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: You must name specific mistakes and ask about them individually. (A) Well, I am not prepared to do that. It is a blur. Just like they said, everything in my head is scrambled.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not prepared due to &#34;shyness.&#34; Remember, we told you about the unfulfilled quest for love, acceptance, approval and to be &#34;needed.&#34; The reason for the failure of the quest is being hasty, impatient and stubborn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, Mother has the most annoying habit of interrupting people when they speak, because she assumes all the time that she knows what is going to be said, and, in fact, she is rarely right, and would receive ALL the information that she wants if she would just be quiet and listen. Sort of the idea of the old saying: we have two ears and one mouth so we can listen twice as much as we talk.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Judge not, lest ye...
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I understand that, but I am trying to help her to get to the issue here...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: She must do this on her own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Okay, any more questions? (A) Well you know I have! (L) Well, I can&#39;t help you. (A) I don&#39;t know where to start now. (L) Well, start at the point where they left you. They said you are hasty, impatient and stubborn. Ask Why? And how can you overcome it? (A) Why have I been so hasty, impatient and stubborn?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Because of past life programming. You see, this is the challenge for all those in third density existences. Some learn in any given lifetime, and some do not!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) But, I had never heard of it!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not necessary. Just follow &#34;the signs.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) Is it that I am so stubborn that I cannot see?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Have been; less so now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) How can I get out of this mess?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Silly question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) I didn&#39;t mean it to be silly. (L) Well, you have to want to and work at it. It is NOT easy. (A) Well, I&#39;ve never SEEN any signs. (L) Oh, don&#39;t start THAT. You have had PLENTY of signs! (A) Well, is this past life experience that you described before, the same one that is at the root of the stubbornness and hastiness?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) Can you add anything to what was told to clarify?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No, not necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Can you give her one or two hints or clues as to where she could start to release some of this toxic emotion she lives with?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is part of the lesson, but it really should be obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) Is this toxic emotion the problem?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What else? (A) Well, I can&#39;t think how to ask anymore questions... (L) Then you should try to digest what you have. Okay, that&#39;s it.
