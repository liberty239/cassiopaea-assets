      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, let&#39;s get going here. Here we go...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Hello spooky ones!! Fiooniaea of Cassiopaea here for the end of the world party!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Andromeda) Well alright! [laughter]
      </p>
      <p>
        (Artemis) I feel like we should be having a DJ as well, or something.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) A DJ? Alright. You see how things get going around here? It just gets crazy sometimes. [laughter] Okay, who&#39;s got questions? [silence] Oh! We&#39;re having a session and nobody has any questions?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Pierre) I have a question: Were the genetic modifications induced by the Black Death virus the main cause of the Renaissance?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not main, but contributory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q:(Laura) Well, what was the main cause?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: 4D influences of a psychic nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Joe) What is driving global governments to officially pursue a transformation to green energy, dropping fossil fuels, and investing in renewables?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Destruction of lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) You know, that&#39;s interesting... I was reading something on the forum today. It was on that thread of alternative 3, for anybody who has read it. Oh no, no no! It was that video, &#34;The Dinosaur&#34;. And the Dinosaur said, &#34;Evil governments are investing in fossil fuels&#34;. And then it turns around and says, &#34;you need green, sustainable blah blah blah&#34;. And it just occurred to me it would take a long period of time to get other forms of energy going. But fossil fuels are the most efficient thing right now, to help in poverty stricken countries. By forcing them to wait on alternative green sources of energy, you&#39;re just extending their dying time! So, it&#39;s a complete contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) Well, not only that, windmills, wind turbines and solar power, they can&#39;t replace the world&#39;s energy needs. They simply can&#39;t. And no government can possibly be sincere in their belief that they can. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking the question. Do they really believe it?
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) No, I think it&#39;s...
      </p>
      <p>
        (Niall) They don&#39;t, so the follow-up question is, are governments consciously trying to destroy lives?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Niall) Crikey!
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Yeah, I think they are becoming quite conscious at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Niall) It&#39;s funny, because Bill Gates came out today and said, &#34;In the short term, we need to keep nuclear power going, because the backlash from the public during this transition to renewables is strong&#34;.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) They&#39;re going to destroy the global economy. You can&#39;t transition in the period of time they&#39;re talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Niall) But at least he was astute enough to say it.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) If they were really going to transition, they should have started back in the 70s when people started talking about this sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) Do you know the UK had an energy shortage this year? Do you know why?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) Because they didn&#39;t get any, or very little power from the windmills because this year the wind didn&#39;t blow strong enough. That&#39;s the energy they&#39;re investing in. They&#39;re going to fuel the world with windmills. That suggests they are kind of on board with a population reduction idea, this big &#34;conspiracy theory&#34; of depopulation... that governments are on board with that, and that they&#39;re saying, &#34;OK, let&#39;s basically switch over to this crazy new energy source that will only be able to sustain a limited amount of people on the planet, and the rest of them will die.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Andromeda) Yeah, in the beginning we could have thought that maybe it was greed, that they were trying to make money, but at this point it&#39;s so obvious that that is not going to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) You can try to make money with a little bit here and there... But it&#39;s not even going to work. 60 percent of China&#39;s energy comes from coal right now. Do you think they&#39;re ever going to be able to build enough windmills that will actually work... with volcanoes going off, and reduced sunlight and that kind of stuff... it&#39;s just not possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Niall) Are China and Russia on board with this?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) They are, officially.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Laura) I notice China and Russia aren&#39;t going to this Climate conference...
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) ...in Scotland.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) So they&#39;re giving it a pass, so maybe they are starting to feel comfortable with giving a pass to other things, I don&#39;t know. Okay, next question.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) About 10 years ago, at around the time of the global banking crisis/crash, some time after that, in 2010 maybe... For some reason we were asking, thinking that the economy was going to implode, or something... And we asked that question, and it was right at this time of the year. &#34;Are they going to crash the economy soon?&#34; And the C&#39;s said, &#34;They might wait till after Christmas&#34;. And of course, nothing happened in the 10 years since then. So I was just wondering if that idea of &#34;after Christmas&#34; applies to...
      </p>
      <p>
        (Andromeda) ...this Christmas? [laughter].
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Scottie) Just wait 10 years and we&#39;ll find out.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Chu) People have started posting questions on the Zoom chat.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) Oh good job! Hold on people, let&#39;s see:
      </p>
      <p>
        (eboard10) Someone on Twitter (Canadian earthquake researcher) predicts that a 10+ earthquake with the epicenter around the Philippines will hit between now and mid-2023 due to the release of an existing blocking of tectonic plates. How likely is that to happen?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: 26%
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Joe) We like those odds.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) Now, of course you could start going and naming other places and other date frames, and all that sort of thing, and we could take hours and hours going through all of that sort of thing, but I don&#39;t like doing that. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like this kind of question.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) You could just ask what area of the globe has a higher chance of having a major earthquake in the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Abats) What about the famous April Drop Dead date?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Coming!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Laura) [reading Zoom chat] Some people can&#39;t hear Joe. All you people are really going to have to speak up for the microphone. Can everybody hear me? Wave your hand if you can. Okay, that&#39;s probably because I&#39;m close to the microphone.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Scottie) That was a microphone problem, but we fixed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        (genero81) Should we ask about Gary?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) No, I don&#39;t think so.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Drea) Let&#39;s hope that someone releases free energy technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) That&#39;s assuming that something like that even exists. I don&#39;t think you get anything for free in this universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Mexican House) What is the real percentage of vaccination in the world? Did they reach their numbers in October?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) I think we already asked that question at a previous session.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Niall) We did. We took the example of France and asked if the official numbers were close to reality, and they said yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Lainey) It would be lovely to know if Gary is well.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) Okay, other people want to know, so we&#39;ll ask about Gary.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Artemis) Maybe we can ask if Gary wants to share anything with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) Well, that&#39;s a bit too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Artemis) Okay, never mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) You have to go through this whole song and dance to do that. They have to re-route the channel, sign off and sign on. It&#39;s a switching problem!
      </p>
      <p>
        (Artemis) They can relay the message themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) Okay, we want to know if Gary is okay.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes, thanks to knowledge and prayers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (nicklebleu and his wife): It has been said that wind has decreased in recent times. Is that true?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: In some places. Has increased in others. Also it is more compacted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Laura) Well, I would imagine that if the climate is changing, you know, moving towards an Ice Age, or whatever it has to go through in order to get there, it&#39;s going to change. Climate change in the past, as they&#39;ve been able to determine by retrospective studies... Places that formerly had rain, no longer have rain, and places that didn&#39;t have rain start getting rain. And I guess, places that didn&#39;t have wind start getting wind, and places that used to have wind don&#39;t get wind... So it&#39;s all about the changes going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) Which is useless for windmills.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Andromeda) Pretty much, yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) Yeah, they&#39;re basing a lot of their so-called &#34;green&#34; activities on situations that existed in the past, and that are no longer going to be existing.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Madara Horseman) Speaking about energy news, we are bombarded with nuclear fusion. Are the different countries really looking for a solution there, or are they mostly hyping and diverting money? Are we close to nuclear fusion in a practical sense, or...?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) Hmm, that&#39;s not a well formed question. It&#39;s hard to break that down. Okay, let me see. Nuclear fusion: Are different countries really looking for a solution, or are they mostly hyping and diverting?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Laura) Are we close to nuclear fusion in a practical sense?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Could be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Laura) Could be - if they really put their minds to it. Okay, here is a question on another topic:
      </p>
      <p>
        (Ryu) Why are some countries (India, Japan, many African countries) &#34;allowed&#34; to use Ivermectin?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not allowed, but conducting experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Ant22) What are the real vaccination levels in the UK, EU and US?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) I don&#39;t want to ask any more questions about vaccination levels. Don&#39;t we have figures on that, and don&#39;t we know that it&#39;s going to be less than what they are telling us?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) Or roughly what they say. That&#39;s the depressing part.
      </p>
      <p>
        (MK Scarlett) In 1972, the Club of Rome wrote a book known as Report Meadows that was about green development and sustainable future, but it was all about depopulation. See the article: What is the &#34;Global Public-Private Partnership&#34;?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Exactly. That is the hidden agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Ellipse) Does the DNA vaccine lower the immune system? If yes, how much [he wrote: &#34;If yes, until which point&#34;]?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Laura) Hmm, I&#39;d say all of the vaccines damage the immune system.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) So, on that other point, Laura, overt governments that are pushing this green agenda, are they aware that the agenda is population reduction? Is that it, they don&#39;t have any other rationale for it? Do they have any other reason for it, or is it just the destructive principle, and they want to kill people?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: They are operating on the premise that there is a real threat to the planet and that the cause is overpopulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I would say that overpopulation only threatens the population, not the planet. The planet can and will recover, but it&#39;s like any of the population studies: when there are too many rabbits...
      </p>
      <p>
        (Andromeda) Disease comes along.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Foxes come along to eat them.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) Maybe they think that overpopulation is a threat to society in the sense that it&#39;s unsustainable in the long term. If you don&#39;t do anything about it, people will die because there&#39;s not enough...
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) I don&#39;t think they&#39;re worried about people dying.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Niall) It&#39;s a threat to psychopathic rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Yeah. Oh boy... We&#39;re in a helluva mess, people.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Pierre) By enforcing those measures aimed at reducing population, they create oppression that triggers natural catastrophes before their plan is put in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) So you&#39;re saying that by...
      </p>
      <p>
        (Pierre) Depopulation agenda entails a lot of lies. By those lies aiming to reduce population, they actually induce cosmically this population reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Yeah. Well, the thing is that then they&#39;ve lost control of the narrative and they&#39;ve lost control of who gets depopulated and who doesn&#39;t. They bring the very thing that they wished on other people on themselves. I mean, the C&#39;s did say it was a triple-bad day for John D. Rockefeller and his type.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Pierre) Economically, biologically, socially, and also FRV. But is it true what we say? That they precipitate the cosmic reaction for manufacturing human suffering. Is it true?
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Pierre) Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Okay...
      </p>
      <p>
        (Redrock12) Will I eventually be cured of my prostate cancer?
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Ya know Redrock, that&#39;s a personal question. But guess what? I&#39;m gonna give it to you.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Control!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, they say, &#34;control&#34;. You&#39;ll be able to control it. You may yet get it so controlled that it&#39;s almost like not even there, especially if you take care of your diet and supplements.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Soluna) If you catch Covid via shedding from a vaccinated person, are you more or less likely to have the possible positive changes?
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Okay, so... That&#39;s assuming that a vaccinated person will have positive mutations. So let&#39;s break this down.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Gaby) Is it possible to have a positive mutation from the vaccines?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Efforts were made to prevent that, so it would be rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So efforts were made to prevent the possibility of a vaccine producing a positive mutation.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Andromeda) So then, if you caught the virus from somebody who was shedding after being vaccinated, it would probably be difficult as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Joe) Which is the whole point of the vaccines, right? Originally in previous sessions, they said the virus got out and they expected it to have this effect on people but it had positive mutations. So then they rolled out the vaccination campaign to prevent the positive mutations from the lab-created virus.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Didn&#39;t we read that book [Genetic Entropy, by John C. Sanford] that said the only real mutations that are observed in a laboratory are negative? They&#39;re like entropic... Well, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Deckard) Is Nano soma really capable of balancing the whole body?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) That was short.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Regulattor) What % of death rate are we to expect next spring due to corona virus mutation/recombination?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Impossible to estimate at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Mrs. Peel) How much longer before, or will they declare Joe Biden incapable of holding the office?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Never! But fate may intervene!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I mean, think about it: The guy is a dithering idiot, which leaves all the bureaucrats and hidden agenda people in the secret services and whatever TOTALLY in charge. He&#39;s nothing but their puppet. That&#39;s why they hated Trump so much. He wasn&#39;t their puppet and he was really trying to do something. He didn&#39;t realize what he was up against when he got in there, and they sure did block him off every way they could. But boy, they got Joe Biden now, and he&#39;s their honey!

        A: Latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I think he was just using the Jewish god as a stand-in. He didn&#39;t really have much in the way of anything to reference. At the time, there were all these different gods. Then of course the Jewish god was claiming to be the only high creator god. That&#39;s what Paul was working with.

      <p>
        Q: (whitecoast) If 4D STS rely on people for food, wouldn&#39;t they want as large (and sick/diminished) a population as possible? Or is the depopulation agenda just about spreading mass misery on the heels of earth changes that may reduce the population sharply anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Well, well remember that a large part of 4D STS food is the energy of pain and suffering. That gives them a huge psychic boost and advantage. So, that right there is a feeding mechanism. But we realize of course that they don&#39;t need the numbers of people that we have on the Earth for their feeding purposes. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite that bad. We know there are a LOT of people missing, unexplained things... Look at this 411 business. But also remember that the C&#39;s pointed out at one point that they had a fallback diet of... what was it? Bovine serum extracted from cows or something so they didn&#39;t have to take so much from humans.

        (L) I suspect Mark might have been a real name. Matthew might have been a real name of somebody who was involved with the writing of Matthew. Then Luke may have been too, but there were also obscure groups of people about them. Read my book and that should become clear.
