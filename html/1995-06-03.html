      <p>
        Q: (L) Tom has a question.
      </p>

        Q: (TF) What happened to my grandfather&#39;s watch?

        A: Which one?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Which grandfather? (TF) Paternal. (L) Okay, what happened to Tom&#39;s paternal grandfather&#39;s gold pocket watch?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Under what water?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: It is clear with some silt or sand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (TF) What is that? (L) I don&#39;t think you are going to get a name because that is an artificial designation.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Visual reference. Shines in the sunlight, slipped off when attention was distracted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (TF) Did it slip off by itself or did someone take it?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: At church.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does that make any sense? (TF) Well, maybe. (T) Do you know where the watch is? (TF) No. (SV) Find out where he went to church and see if there is any water around there. (L) Maybe his father was nowhere near at the time. (TF) My father never went to church; he was an athiest. Did my father have anything to do with the disappearance?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Was his father at church? You say his father was at church; Tom says his father didn&#39;t go to church. Why was his father at church?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not only reason one goes to a church, think!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) It might have been a meeting of some kind... (T) A wedding; a funeral... (TF) You&#39;re right. It&#39;s not that he never set foot inside a church. (F) He&#39;s not that much of an athiest! (T) Especially weddings; there&#39;s food after weddings! (TF) Okay, well, one more and then I&#39;ll be quiet! Was the watch lost or was it taken?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Has this bugged you a long time? (TF) Not too long. A while.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) I have a question to ask about Tom. Tom had a dream that he shared with me, and I think he wouldn&#39;t mind sharing it with the group. Tom?
      </p>
      <p>
        (TF) In the dream I am on an ocean liner. There are other people on board the ship, but I am not talking to them. I&#39;m not with my friends or family. I am by myself. I among all these people, but I am not with them. It is a long journey. I walk back and forth on deck. Finally we come to a city, a major city, a seaport. I get off the ship; I walk through the city; I walk through the center of the city to the outskirts, into the countryside. The countryside is red; reddish all around. The streets are no longer paved; now they are dirt, red dirt. I come to a big house with a white picket fence under the shadow of a mountain. I know that I am supposed to be in this house. I go inside the house, there are other people there. Again, I am not talking with them when I first get there, and as the days begin to pass I do begin to talk to them and they begin to talk to me. I begin to feel better. Suddenly, in the dream, I realize that when I was first walking through the city toward the house, I was a dog; in the early days when I had first been in the house, I was being transformed into a human being, and that all the other people in the house were once animals; and that that was why we were at the house, to learn how to become a human being. It had something to do with the power of the mountain. (L) Now, the question I have is: is there some significance to this dream that you can comment on?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not of great significance in a psychic sense, merely a reflection of the subject&#39;s awareness of metamorphosis within his own life path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, that was Tom&#39;s interpretation and it blew my theory all to hell! (T) What was your theory? (L) Well, I was just sure he was an alien and he came to Earth on this big ship from the Dog Star, Sirius... (J) To Georgia!! [Laughter] I liked my interpretation better! (T) Make for a heck of a book! (SV) She&#39;s been watching too many of those UfO videos!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Active imagination!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I got told! Now, our questions. Why did the Incas and other South American cultures create their cultural environment in mountainous areas where they were forced to terrace to grow food, whereas the European culture developed on level terrain, mined in the mountains... (T) And a lot of them starved because they didn&#39;t use the mountains correctly...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Mountains were of a different nature in two cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, the mountainous terrain was more fertile in one area than the other; is that the point we are getting at here?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Bingo!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) That was what I thought. (T) Did the Europeans try terrace farming?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Why? (T) Yeah, they built aqueducts, why not terraces?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Why should they try something unnecessary?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Why was it unnecessary? (L) No, we know that. They had plenty of arable land that was flat. Why was it necessary in South America? (J) Because they didn&#39;t. They had to use what they had.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Works for me! (L) It was said in a previous transmission that the area around my house was a &#34;multiple reality station.&#34; Is this because of our activities, or is this a pre-existing condition of this house and general location?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Two questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is this because of our activities?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Partially.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it also a pre-existing condition of this area?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: In a roundabout way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this have anything to do with the purported tunnel beneath the house?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Ditto last response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, you say &#34;in a roundabout way.&#34; What is the roundabout way? What is the relationship?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Crustal energy flow patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Terrry) What is crustal energy?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Self-explanatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Okay, it&#39;s the energy that is flowing through the crust we are talking about, or the energy the crust is making... we are talking plate tectonics here? (J) Yes, plate tectonics?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Too many comments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Q: (T) How close to electromagnetism? (L) How close can you get? (T) Right! [Laughter]
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Related.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, is this an energy flow pattern that is significantly different at this point in space/time as opposed to, say... (J) Our house?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not correct concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) It&#39;s not related to space and time?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are getting &#34;colder.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) It is not related to space/time. Is it related to a gridwork of energy?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not gridwork, more like &#34;halo.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>

        Q: (L) Is it particularly beneficial in terms of this kind of work?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) It is obviously not detrimental. (T) Can it be detrimental?

      <p class="answer">

      <p class="answer">
        A: 64000 dollar question!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Now, since we hit the 64,000 dollar question, are you going to give us the 64,000 dollar answer? (L) Why could it be detrimental? Is it because it could be detrimental if a person is following the STO pathway?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Could it be detrimental to one following the STS pathway?

        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Okay, the energy flow pattern can be detrimental or beneficial. It&#39;s just energy, not positive or negative.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: This is more complex than your queries allow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In other words, our questions are not complex enough to get the answer?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are &#34;rushing it&#34; due to company present, now please relax and just behave as always.

        Q: (J) She&#39;s trying to show off! (L) I am not! (SV) That&#39;s what they said! (L) That&#39;s not what they said, and I am not the only one asking questions. (T) Let&#39;s start over with something simple. We are talking about the aura or something similar. The planet&#39;s aura.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p class="answer">
        A: Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) You have indicated that there is some kind of a correlation between the location and the energy in the planet. The energy in the planet is all the way around the planet and is affected by the planet and everything that goes on around the planet, in the planet, on top of the planet and all over the place. We are one location. As this energy ebbs and flows along it influences the work we are doing here. Am I on track here?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Okay. So, the crustal energy flow patterns, if they ebb, we lose power... we need to draw more power in order to keep the connection?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) I don&#39;t even know what I said! (L) Try it this way. We are talking about an aura. In an aura system in the physical body, it can sometimes reflect both the spiritual and physical state of the person. Is this location similar to a chakra?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If you prefer or other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Similar to a chakra?

        A: These are all merely labels.

      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, so it is like an energy vortex?

        A: Okay...
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) An energy vortex in the body, a chakra in the body, is a place where the body energy interfaces with the universe. Tell us about chakras, Susan. (SV) There are all different kinds. There are the seven major chakras, the ones in the palms, almost every joint in the body has a chakra... (T) What do they do? (L) An interface point? (SV) Yes. (L) Is this what we are talking about here? An interface between this density and other densities?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: First of all, &#34;chakras&#34; are a little understood and non-proven phenomenon. Now, it just so happens they do exist, but in different form than reported by many in the so called &#34;psychic&#34; community. So you see, you have opened yet another &#34;can of worms.&#34;
      </p>

      <p>
        Q: (T) A focus point that merges densities to fifth density contemplation level?
      </p>

        Q: (SV) But what about what Barbara Marciniak said about the chakras... she talked about 12 chakras, seven internal and five external? Was Barbara onto something?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Vague.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) It was not what Barbara was onto, it was the information she was being given. (L) Was the information Barbara was given as far as the chakras, correct as far as it went?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, there&#39;s a clue. (T) It better be, we gave it to her. (J) True. (T) If they said no... (J) ...we are in a lot of trouble. We had better find something else to do on Saturday night. (L) We could bowl. Canasta, anyone? This would make a great card table. (J) Bridge? (L) I don&#39;t know how everyone else feels about it, but maybe we should just read Marciniak on this one for now and drop the subject. (T) They have been saying that the chakras as they have been taught may not be entirely accurate. The information about these energy points is that they do not exist as they have been laid out by others, but that they exist in different people in different places because of the way the energy flows in each individual. They don&#39;t always exist in the same place just as the energy vortexes on the planet fluctuate and change. So, within the person the energy changes and fluctuates... (J) Do the chakras move around?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: They may.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Do different people have different numbers of chakras?

      <p>
        Q: (T) So, the whole idea of chakra work, not to take anything away from what Susan has been doing, is very much incorrect as it is laid out?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (SV) Okay, if you sensitize your hands, could you pick up on this energy on the body? Could you detect the chakras?

      <p>
        Q: (SV) I guess maybe I had better find out. (L) How does all of this relate to this house and what we are doing here? (T) We are working on a larger scale now. (L) Does this house have something to do with connecting up chakras in our bodies?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are drifting again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Is it that this energy will move just like the energy in a body will move. We are working at this point because, at this time, this is where the localized energy is in this area, but that this is going to be moving?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Again, you have touched upon a group of subjects that require massive study to accurately explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) Does this mean that we have to study and learn more before we can even discuss this with you?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.

        Q: (SV) Would Edgar Cayce&#39;s material be a good place to start?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are you suggesting that perhaps this is a subject that we don&#39;t need to go into?

        A: Up to you.
      </p>

        Q: (L) Let&#39;s go onto something else that is more simple. The other night the children saw some lights in the sky. I went out to see what they were talking about and at that point there were no moving lights, but there was a single, pulsating, red light about ten degrees to the right of Jupiter. My initial reaction to it was that it was atmospheric twinkle of a large red star or the planet Mars. There was nothing there the following night. What was it the children saw?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Children saw planes and a helicopter.

      </p>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, what do they do during thunderstorms if they don&#39;t fly? (J) They bob and weave! (SV) They are projections, aren&#39;t they? (J) Yeah, I don&#39;t think they are actually here, down in the atmosphere, anyway.

      <p>
        Q: (T) Is the fact that there are very few abduction cases, at least I read about, and I&#39;ve read quite a few of them, during thunderstorms, have to do with the thunderstorm interfering with the EM, so that the abduction would be much harder to do, therefore they don&#39;t bother doing it?

      <p class="answer">
        A: No.

      <p>
        Q: (J) Can they control it. (T) Well, I haven&#39;t read very many things about abductions during storms. (L) Well, I have read about a few, enough to break it as a rule. (T) Is there some reason that it isn&#39;t happening as often during thunderstorms? (J) They don&#39;t want to get wet.

        Q: (TF) I want to ask one more question about the watch. Which state of the Union is the body of water located where the watch is?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Do not know, as we access visual reference only, and cannot determine artificially designated borders in this instance. If watch were lost next to road sign, for example, it might be different!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (TF) Is the area around the body of water flat or mountainous?

        Q: (TF) Was it a ceremony involving one of his children?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Maybe is a better answer than &#34;open.&#34; (L) Jan, tell Tom about your Margaret S___ thing. (J) God, I can&#39;t believe you remembered that name! (L) I remember everything I type after I type it!
      </p>
      <p>
        (J) That&#39;s amazing. Yeah, I had a little thing that I wanted the Cassiopaeans to answer for me, and they had a real hard time visualizing it for me... they just kind of focus in on...
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) No, they visualized it extremely well; they saw you in a basement with your friends with candles and they described it as some sort of ritual activity. Jan wanted them to tell what she was doing...
      </p>
      <p>
        (J) Actually, I wanted them to repeat a phrase... we were doing, I guess, some sort of black magic, trying to put the whammy on a biology teacher that nobody liked... [Laughter]
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Jan has a past...
      </p>
      <p>
        (T) The thing is, with the channel, they see what we see, they know what we know... what&#39;s in your mind and subconscious...
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) ...or what you saw...
      </p>
      <p>
        (T) Anything that is not within the channel itself, they cannot pick up...
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Oh, no! They have come through with tons of stuff that&#39;s not in this room or in anybody&#39;s mind in here!
      </p>
      <p>
        (TF) If they only know what&#39;s in ya&#39;ll&#39;s mind, how can you ask questions about Jesus... how could that be within...
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) I think what they do is focus on a point in space/time that they access like a computer, but that all of the artificial constructions that we have created to separate and define are like Greek to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        (J) Well, time is definitely something that man has created because we live on a planet that has days and nights and the passage of seasons. If we lived on a planet that did not have days and nights and passing seasons, we would not have the concept of time. (F) Or, if you were floating around in space...
      </p>
      <p>
        (J) ...then you wouldn&#39;t have up or down either...
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) The other night I was looking for a bottle of ear drops. We asked the Cassiopaeans where they were. They said: in the bedroom, drawer, white cloth and symbols. Well, I found them in a make-up bag on top of the drawer, the bag being lined with white cloth. And, what is make-up but &#34;symbols?&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        (F) That&#39;s interesting because I had forgotten about that.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Yes, it is strange what is accessed and how it is represented. Tom, do you think there are going to be changes at the Times?
      </p>
      <p>
        (TF) No.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Well, you might want to consider getting this thing finished as soon as possible anyway...

      <p class="answer">
        A: Will be a &#34;take-over,&#34; count on it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (TF) I guess there could be different kinds of take-overs. (J) Yeah. It could be just a change in management. (L) Okay, Cherie, do you have any other questions? [Laughter] (C) I&#39;m thinking. (L) Now that you opened that can of worms... (J) Worms are Us! (TF) I didn&#39;t mean to monopolize this session... (J) You didn&#39;t. Don&#39;t worry about it! (T) Not at all! (LM) [just coming in the room] What was the question and what was the answer? (L) It was a whole series of them. Cherie asked a question that opened a whole can of worms. (TF) Bottom line is: I have to write quickly! (L) Yes, worms came squirming out all over the place. (J) Changes, take-overs... change of atmosphere... (L) What would you do if that happened? (TF) I don&#39;t know... you just have to roll with the punches. (L) Okay, they don&#39;t want me to ask any of my time travel questions... (T) I am at zero energy level tonight... (L) That must be what our problem is. Terry is over there zoning out on us. (TF) What do you mean &#34;what your problem is?&#34; (L) Well, when any one of us has low energy, it limits the reception. (J) Why is Terry&#39;s energy is so low tonight?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (SV) Don&#39;t breathe this way! (T) Ebola is here! (L) I was curious about the kamikaze virus I had the other day. It made me think about virii in general. Since virii don&#39;t have DNA, is it possible that they could be used to modify DNA?

        Q: (L) Okay. (J) When I got home from work the other day. I realized that I was hungry and suddenly I got the shakes and I was real dizzy. I rushed in and made myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and drank a glass of milk and it seemed to calm me down. Was this because I had not eaten?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      <p class="answer">

      <p class="answer">
        A: No, no.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Neither. Was it just a momentary low blood sugar condition from working too long without eating?

      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (TF) He had a series of dreams one summer, 1943, and it was interesting because his father, the dream analyst, could help him with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        (F) Was his father a dream analyst?
      </p>
      <p>
        (TF) Right. The same one that lost the watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        (L) Was there some kind of antagonism between them?
