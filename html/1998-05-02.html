        A: Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: And who do we have this evening with us?
      </p>

        Q: We have some questions about this job situation. There is this Kanev, and we spent 4 or 5 hours there yesterday, and it could be something important, but it might be months and months before any money can be made. This is one possibility of making some money. Working with this program that writes web pages. Could we have a two or three word reaction to that?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Why is it for &#34;next to nothing?&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, because the two guys who have created this program are just getting started, they haven&#39;t marketed it yet, they haven&#39;t got it going yet, they have a fledgling company, supposedly, they have a lot of big plans, we don&#39;t know all the details, for some people these things work out, for some people they don&#39;t. Look at Microsoft!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Do they expect assistance for a pittance?
      </p>
      <p>

        A: One would expect one to question them as to how they expect their assistant, a rare find by the way, to pay the bills?

      <p>
        Q: Well, Ark thinks that he can learn something from this program...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If Ark presses, there will be capitulation, due to Slavic familiarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: These guys don&#39;t have anything, I don&#39;t think. They are working out of their bedroom in a little shack on a back street in Alachua! What good is pressing them going to do?!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Ever heard of venture capitalists?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Yes, I have, but the thing is that we have to have money THIS month. Venture capitalists and all that are fine and dandy...

        A: So then you never will, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: No. Okay, there is the other job... the one with Constellation... what about this possibility? Doing some sort of classified pattern recognition, building atomic detectors, or something, and it would be close... and it is basically the Enterprise Florida thing...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Will hire. Good money.

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, that is funny. You never made predictions before, why now?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not a prediction, a fact. You see, as before, we have always assured you that you would be provided for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, I would really like to finish the work on the house and I don&#39;t have the money to do any more. (Frank develops headache. Pause, discussion about mother.) Okay, since you gave mother advice about going down the primrose path and she did it anyway...
