      The following was a rather frustrating session. The situation was that Ark was teaching at the Uni of FL in Gainesville and he would be there all week and I would go pick him up on Friday to come home for the weekend. The best route included a very long stretch of two-lane blacktop through a planted pine forest, a road that was traveled mostly by logging trucks. I mean, miles and miles and miles of solitary forest. So, I was going along and the heat gauge was showing above normal temp though not exactly dangerous. So, I decided to stop and check it out and add some coolant which I always carried in the back. While I was stopped waiting for the van to cool down a bit, a guy in a pick-up stopped to see if I needed help. For some reason, as soon as the hood was open, the radiator cap flew off. However, the van itself did not seem to be particularly hot. It didn&#39;t need more than a cup of coolant. The problem was to find the now disappeared radiator cap! Eventually it was found UNDER the van. Don&#39;t ask. So, I finally make it to Gainesville and it is VERY late. Like missing time late. I was totally freaked out. On our drive back, just before we turned off on that same road to go home, we had to stop and wait for a huge irrigator to be moved across the road from one field to another. And then, even though this was not a long stop, it took us longer to get home than the very long time it took me to get to Gainesville!
