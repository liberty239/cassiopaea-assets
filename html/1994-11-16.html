      <p>
        A: By dispersing knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Dispersing as in breaking apart or scattering?
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I dreamed last night about a puppy belonging to my sister in law. As I was walking away in the dream, I turned back and saw a car run over the dog. It was quite graphic and I awoke very upset. What was the cause or purpose of this dream?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) If the Lizzies have been feeding off of us frequently and are planning to come and take over our planet, why, when they achieved their domination 300,000 years ago, did they not just move here and take up residence and be in charge?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No desire to inhabit same realm.

        Q: (L) Why are they planning to now?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: They want to rule you in 4th density.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) If the mother planet that the human race was seeded on originally, is burned up, or turned into a cinder, I would like to know how it burned up?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Star expanded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, if the star expanded, it must have expanded recently, is that correct?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Time does not measure that way in that realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What realm is that?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Time/space warp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What do you mean by a time/space warp?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Too complicated but you already have some understanding of concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, the star expanded and the mother planet was turned into a cinder. If this was the case, it means that it must have turned into a cinder very close to the point, using time loosely, when human beings were created?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You can&#39;t even use it loosely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Would you help me out here. I&#39;m trying to figure out why, if that planet was turned into a cinder, why were human beings seeded there... what was the point in being brought into being on a planet that was very shortly to become a cinder... a crispy critter...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Okay. Now: &#34;Shocker&#34; For you. It hasn&#39;t become a cinder yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay. What is it. You told us it was a cinder... burned up... what is the real story here?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: It will be at the same &#34;time&#34; that you go to 4th density. The human race is currently being formed on D&#39;Ahnkiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What do you mean that the human race is currently being formed on that planet? Is that because that planet is this planet?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No. That closes realm grand cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are you saying that there are human beings being created on that planet at this current time...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes, you are. Your race is forming there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) How?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Realm crossing understand?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are you saying that there are 4th density bodies being formed there...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No. 3rd.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) There are 3rd density bodies... are we going to leave the bodies we are in and go into other bodies?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You are drifting... Think carefully. Realm is derivative of reality. Cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So the human race is being formed on this other planet at the present time...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And at the time of the realm border crossing, this other planet will then become cindered... burned up...
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Where will the human beings go that are being formed on that planet at the time of the realm border crossing?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Ancient earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) They will go to ancient earth?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: There is no time as you know it; its all just lessons for the collective consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So at the closing of this grand cycle everything will just start all over again?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Not exactly; you see, there is no start.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are a lot of souls on the earth going to recycle into these new bodies coming onto the earth?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) As ancient mankind?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And do the whole thing all over again?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, in other words, a lot of people are going back to square one?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is this punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No. Nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are some of the souls, at that point, going to move into a higher density level?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Could you give us a percentage on this?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No. Open at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, getting back to the planet, if at some point in the cycle, bodies were generated on this planet and brought to earth, who brought them?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Realm crossing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) It was not a who, it was a what, is that correct?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: All is who and what.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, the other night you mentioned something about the Transient Passengers hauling these bodies off that planet and bringing them to earth, is that correct?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, are these Transient Passengers Realms?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes. So are you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do you guys know what you are doing to the linear mind here?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Can of worms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) You said something the other night when we lost the tape about the expansion of the star being conducive to creation. Could you give us a little bit on that aspect?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Transdimensional Atomic remolecularization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is Remolecularization.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Being reassembled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Reassembled from what to what?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Complex. Density collision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Collision of one density with another. Which?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Learn 4 level assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) How?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Study.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this mean that this was a point in space time when pure energy could form around a framework of a thought pattern and thus become solid matter?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is this transitioning of energy from higher densities into third density or solid matter kind of a traumatic event for universal energy?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it a form of death?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Death and birth are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Was it a requirement to be on a planet with a dying star for this remolecularization to take place?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: If 3rd density remolecularization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, for energy to go into 3rd density physical level... is energy moving down when it comes into 3rd level?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No. Upward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What moves upward?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Molecules, atomic matter. Light is first density and unifies all densities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does that mean that by us moving from 3rd density into 4th density that we are getting farther away from unification with the source?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No. Light and darkness unify all densities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) How many levels of density are there?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: 7
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) When you reach the seventh level, how would you describe that if 1st level is light?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: 7th is core of existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, if seventh density is the core of existence, would that mean that 1st density is the outer edge of existence?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) When one has reached 7th density, then what does one do?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: When one reaches 7th all do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are there any beings on 7th level?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Time does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) When light is transferred to electrical energy, does it actually change density?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it from 1st to 3rd when it becomes electricity?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Once again, are there any beings on 7th level?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Big bang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Big bang is at 7th level?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Close enough.
      </p>
