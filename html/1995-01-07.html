      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) We have a few interesting questions tonight. I think the first thing on everybody&#39;s mind is the strange events during the night and early morning hours, reported by Terry and Jan compared with events that happened that John said that he experienced and also, Terry&#39;s dad, and also something woke A__ up with a start and I was awakened with a strange feeling. We are a little bit curious about this event, this occurrence, and we would like to have some information on it. What exactly was it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Thunder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) It seemed to be an extraordinarily massive strike, and it seemed to have been heard at a great distance in several directions. Where, in fact, did this lightning bolt strike?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Cell was uniformly structured throughout region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So we all heard that particular blast because of that?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. Each zone received similar EM profile, thus one particularly heavily charged event in each zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is an EM profile?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Electromagnetic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Was there any particular significance to this type of blast since it is not something any of us has experienced in our immediate memory. Is there any implication to this blast in terms of 4th density activity?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You have, and yes, as always.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Since this was such a boomer, what exactly was going on on 4th density that produced a boomer like this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Overlapping densities, lasting approximately 1.3 seconds, as you measure time i.e.: for 1.3 seconds, you lived completely in 4th density.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So this was a significant event for us to have noticed?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: The noticing was more significant than the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Can I ask... so every time there is... am I wrong in assuming that every time there is thunder there is a mix of 4th density? (L) No, no. (V) It&#39;s just this one time? (T) What about if you didn&#39;t notice? I didn&#39;t hear it. (T) What was the answer? (L) The noticing was more important than the event. (T) So it was important that we were aware that something had happened...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You did at another level of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Did this event have anything to do with A__&#39;s experience this morning of being awakened by a rustling in her room and thinking that she heard a squeaky voice calling her name?

      <p class="answer">
        A: What we told you with the first answer applies. Does not have to be painful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) I have been married twice. The day before I was to marry the man who I thought was wonderful, of course, I was told that no one was going to make me marry him, and that if I wanted to I could change my mind. I had reservations but I did not feel that I could back out because the wedding was already set. And it turned out to be a very destructive marriage and divorce. So, what I am saying to you is that if everything is not perfect about your mate, in terms of your expectations and needs, if there is anything that you think you can or have to change about this person, or that involvement with you will change, you are wrong. You can&#39;t change them, they won&#39;t change, and the relationship will deteriorate destructively. If you are now asking what you have to do to &#34;make&#34; it work, it is already on the road to destruction. It is never to late to come to your senses and back out.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there a past life or karmic tie between T__ and Andrea?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: As always. It is up to him to discover. He is rebellious and is not listening. We have given much, now it is up to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is anyone in this room not rebellious? (Chorus) I am! (L) Have we not all learned the hard way? (Chorus) I certainly have... yes... (V) We have all learned the lesson we see T__ facing. It&#39;s easy for us to sit back and know the end result because we have all been through it before. It&#39;s easy for us to tell him to back away and rethink because we have all been forced to do it but we need to remember how painful it was to us at the time and how we all thought it was the end of the world. (L) Yes. We all thought that ending destructive relationships was the hardest thing in the world to do... other people gave us advice when we were younger like we are advising T__ now, and we didn&#39;t take it... (L) But how much easier on us it would have been if we had the wisdom then to do what we see now... (Chorus) Amen!

(L) No, T__, the chances are not good either way, but you have something of a chance here with a good support system and your metaphysical network. There, it is certain to fail and then you will be in emotional turmoil, probably broke, and stuck far away from everybody. (V) There is not a pat answer on your relationship, they just said if you stay here, it has a better chance. They didn&#39;t say that if you stay, you definitely will succeed...

It&#39;s an illusion, it&#39;s a lie... (T) It&#39;s part of the 3rd density world we have created... (D) I&#39;m trying real hard... (F) Okay, let me give you an example: Take yourself off the planet, take yourself farther away so you can&#39;t see the sun anymore except as a speck. (D) Okay, I&#39;m there... (F) Now you are floating out there in space... there is no direction, everything is just out from you... there is no up or down or sideways... nothing... You see stars every way you look, but there is no point of orientation... Now, being no longer on the planet, the sun doesn&#39;t rise and the sun doesn&#39;t set... you have no watch or clock... how do you know what was before and what was after... (T) Have you ever heard of people who go down into caves to do research experiments, and they come out thinking that only 45 days have passed when it has really been 65 or a hundred... because time slows down and virtually stops. Time is a human concept. (F) I read the book about the Barbara Mackle abduction. She was kidnapped by a guy who put her into an underground coffin with gadgets to help her survive, and she was buried... she thought, when she was pulled out, 83 hours later, she thought she had only been in there one night. (L) Let&#39;s ask this question: In a state where there are no artificial considerations such as the delineation of night and day, in such a state, what would be the natural cycle of the human physical body in terms of, say, sleeping or eating, and refer this back to our concept of time. In other words, how long would we naturally stay awake, and then how long would we naturally sleep if we were not constrained by artificial time references, in a general sense?

        Q: (L) Sitchin has an interesting idea about his theorized planet Nebiru, that their solar year is 3,600 of our years, and, therefore, for every one year of their life, 3,600 years pass on earth, and therefore a being who theoretically was on such a planet, one with a 3,600 year orbit, would live many multiple thousands of years. Is this a valid concept insofar as it goes?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is a confused cross conceptualization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, is that confusion as I presented it, or confusion as Sitchin theorized it?
      </p>

        A: It&#39;s the whole gang.

        Q: (T) We have to remember that time is only relative to earth, and it came about the way it is now only because of mathematics based on base 10 counting system. If you go to the moon, time is not reflected in the same way, if you have to measure it, as it is here. We use earth time on the moon. If we were to go to Mars, Mars time would be different. It is all based on rotation and orbit, which is only one way of doing it. As an example, not exactly having to do with time, but the idea of pi, 3.1416. On the SETI program they send out pi on a radio program saying: &#34;Intelligent life will understand pi because pi is a basic idea in circular mathematics.&#34; You have to be able to figure pi in order to calculate circumference and diameter and so on in circles and arcs. So, I ask, what is the good of sending out pi in base ten when, say, the Grays only have 8 digits on their fingers? What is pi in base 8? 3.1416 means absolutely nothing to someone who is working in another system base.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Grays are cybergenetic beings, therefore they use mathematics they are programmed to use.

        Q: (L) Okay now, the Grays are programmed to use mathematics. I am assuming that they are programmed to use the mathematics of the Lizard beings, their creators, is that correct?

        A: Variable.

      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, the question I am trying to get at here is, what base do the Lizards use?

        Q: (L) Well, I would imagine so. Now, if a line is defined as the movement of a point in a single direction, and a plane is defined as a line moving at right angles to itself, and the 3rd dimension is defined as a plane moving at righ angles to itself, and the 4th dimension is defined as a three dimensional object moving at right angles to itself, then what we are talking about in 4th density, something that we simply cannot grasp. If we look at a 3 D apple, we are only seeing a slice, so to speak, of a 4th dimensional object. If we could see the apple in its true, 4th dimensional state, we would see something, probably more like a long, red tubular type thing that goes onto infinity. Is this a correct assessment?

      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) And then there is 5th, 6th and 7th density levels. The whole point is to demonstrate that time doesn&#39;t exist and is irrelevant. It could be defined in any countless numbers of ways.

        Q: (L) Let me ask this: I am kind of drifting into another subject, but we are talking about being in space. We talked at one point, I believe, of the matrices of the various planets and our perceptions of the planets in our solar system, and these matrices being almost like a doorway to another density, and that if we were in the proper dimensional mode that we would see the other planets of our own solar system quite differently from how we see them in our third density mode, and that we would, in fact, be able to look upon Venus, which manifests in 3rd density as a pretty hellish place, with temperatures 900 degrees or thereabouts, and we would find it to be something else altogether with beings inhabiting it, is this correct.

      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes, and you have a limited understanding of the densities above you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, that is still begging the question, my question was... (T) As an example, today we all experienced something we call thunder, but we were all aware that it was something more. Something happened in 4th density that we experienced in a certain way, and it was a limited understanding of that level.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Laura, unblock, do rocks and plants &#34;see&#34; you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) Probably not. (D) We don&#39;t really know. (T) We see the 3rd density manifestations of 1st density objects. We don&#39;t see the 1st density perception of itself. So, how do we see the 4th density manifestations, they see us on a 4th density level... not necessarily as we perceive ourselves.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Tom, you are making rapid progress. Laura better watch her Butt! {laughter}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) So, I am curious... what do rocks look like to each other? (L) Let&#39;s ask. What do rocks see when they look at each other?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: They sense each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What example of our sensory apparatus would be close to an example of what a rock senses when it is aware of another rock?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is a cross conceptualization and will not work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So there is no way we can interpret what a rock senses. Well, another 1st density example is plants. We know that plants can react positively to certain persons and negatively to others. They have experimented with hooking them up to polygraph machines and measured these responses. (J) They also react to music... (T) Third density reactions...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) If plants interact with each other, do they feel, say, fondness for one another?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Something akin to that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does it hurt a plant when we eat it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Does it hurt you when a &#34;Lizzie&#34; eats you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Yes, you see, on 4th density... we are on 3rd density and we eat 1st and 2nd density, the 4th density eats us. (D) If we hurt plants by eating them like the Lizzies hurt us when they eat us, how are we to survive without eating?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: When you no longer crave physicality, you no longer need to &#34;eat.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So part of the &#34;fall&#34; into the physical existence and part of the Edenic story of the whole business, &#34;you shall eat by the sweat of your brow,&#34; has to do with being physical and needing to eat?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Lucifer, &#34;The fallen Angel.&#34; This is you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, &#34;falling&#34; means going into physical existence wherein you must feed on other life, other beings, is that it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) When plants feed on 1st level beings such as rocks and water and so forth, do the 1st density beings feel pain?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is redundant. We have already covered this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So when a plant absorbs nutrients.... (L) Well, a plant is the same density as minerals, so it is almost like... (T) Like two separate entities becoming one? (V) Like Jeffrey Dahmer... {laughter} (L) My bologne has a first name... (LM) Minerals dissolve in water and are then absorbed by the plant, what pain could there be in this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Subjective, L__.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Maybe the dissolution of, say, phosphate in water, is a &#34;death&#34; to it...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close. You limit when you perceive on 3rd level only and think that your perception is all there is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, in other words, we should be able to perceive on 1st and 2nd as well as 3rd while working on 4th level understanding?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. Work on 4th, 5th and 6th.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it not also beneficial to understand the 1st and 2nd density levels as well, just simply for the exercise in understanding that which is below us?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Strive always to rise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) Haven&#39;t we already done our 1st and 2nd level work as evolving souls?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) So there is no reason to step back. (T) Who eats the Lizzies on the 4th level?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No one. 4th is the last density for full manifestation of STS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So, beings on the 5th and 6th level exist in pure energy?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) The 4th level is the last for full STS. Does that mean that the 5th level, which you have described as the &#34;contemmplative&#34; level... what is the state of existence of a STS being on the 5th level?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Souls of 1,2,3, and 4 go to 5th.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So 5th level is where they go to while waiting to go back to one of the 4 for their next incarnation?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) That is why it&#39;s called the contemplation level. You go and think about what you have done. (T) What about souls on 6th density? (L) Are there 6th density STS beings?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No, when you get to 6th you no longer need to recycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) But still, is there an STS experience at 6th density, like the 6th density Orions?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: These are only reflections of individuals, not unified entities. These reflections exist for balance. They are not whole entities, just thought forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are these 6th density beings what the Bible describes as a &#34;gathering&#34; of angels as in the story of Job where &#34;Lucifer&#34; came in before the Lord...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, there are STS and STO at 6th density which balance? And they are just there, they exist?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Reflection for balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there any kind of hierarchy to this thing? Do these beings come before some kind of &#34;Grand Council&#34; and make plans and discuss things, and make decisions and implement them?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, how do things happen? Do things just sort of happen as a natural interaction of things and energies?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) If we are on the 3rd density and you are working with us and we are striving to make 4th density, at the same time are you, at 6th density, striving to reach 7th?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Is helping us, helping you to reach 7th density? (V) Are there others at higher densities working with you as you are working with us?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No, we all reach 7th level together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, in other words, you guys are trying to bring us up and everbody else is coming up, and when all the pieces are back together, we then go to 7th, is that it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So that is your purpose in helping us?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: It&#39;s a natural process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Will our function be, when we are at 6th density, to help others on 3rd, as you are doing?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes. We are you in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) When more than 50 per cent of the souls reach 6th density in preparation to go to 7th density, will all the rest of them automatically manifest into that density?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not correct concept. You are using 3rd density &#34;Brotherhood&#34; inspired mathematical calculations and ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) So, there are no percentages involved in it. (T) So, we have to get every single soul up there. (V) I don&#39;t think it is as much that as that you can&#39;t apply 3rd density mathematics to that level. (T) Let&#39;s say a majority.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. Still using 3rd density mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, what criteria constitutes the means of this ultimate translation into 7th density?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: The lessons completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) Okay. (T) When all the souls transition to 7th density, will all the souls be integrated into one soul?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So that is why we have to get everybody, because we all become one on 7th density. (D) What will we then do to change the game and make it interesting again?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Don&#39;t have to &#34;do&#34; anything, has, will, is!!!

        Q: (L) Was he, in fact, the reincarnation of King David as he claimed?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If he prefers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) He lost me when he went off on his thing about women and that souls reincarnated as only one sex. (J) No, that&#39;s not so and I think switching sex has a lot to do with homosexuality. (L) Yes. (T) But I do think that a soul has a tendency to be more of one than the other.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I think it ends up being balanced.

        Q: (J) Does the human state of sexuality, such as homosexuality, have something to do with changing sexes from one lifetime to another?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Of all the modes of sexual expression,  which one is more likely to advance one to 4th density more rapidly?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Total celibacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Well then I&#39;m okay! {laughter} (V) Can you explain why total celibacy?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Because you are then &#34;letting go&#34; of the cravings for physicality. {That is, celibacy when one has let go of cravings is effortless. Celibacy that is an effort is probably not positive because it is done in an effort to GET something, i.e. advance to 4D.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) It is a 3rd density act which entices you to 3rd density. (L) Okay, now, what is the second most likely for advancement? {laughter} (D) We have me taken care of, now we&#39;re going to get you taken care of! (J) In order of importance... {laughter}
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Does it matter?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) It does to Laura, would you please answer? (L) I suppose that everyone should get to the point that they would simply desire to be totally celibate and totally let go of all physical things and so forth, but, we have left to us, at this point, heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality and multisexuality {laughter} (D) We also have the ability to take pleasure in our physical bodies in those forms of sexuality. We have the ability to have pleasure in the flesh and they can&#39;t. And, what I have read, is that they envy that. (L) Is that true, that you envy our physicality?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. Not in the least!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I have read that when you are at the higher spiritual levels that you can do a spiritual merge which is better than orgasm. Is that true?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Why do you need orgasm of any kind?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, it does seem to be like one of the ultimate experiences of physicality. (T) That&#39;s exactly it... it&#39;s physicality... (L) If that is so, isn&#39;t everything that exists in the physical, 3rd density world, in some way a reflection of experiences or states of being on higher realms?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: 3rd density as you experience it is an illusion you have been fed to continue your imprisonment therein.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, in other words, there is no cosmic orgasm that keeps the worlds in existence as exemplified by the eternally copulating Vishnu and Shiva?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is Bull! {laughter}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, they teach this stuff in the Eastern religions and they even have the idols sculpted in this posture...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is a rationalization to continue the illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, in other words, the orgasmic experience is quite literally a lure to keep us... (D) Controlled... (T) And in the third level... (L) Is that true?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Let&#39;s go back to a question I asked in another session on this same subject: what happens to our energy at the point of orgasm? Where does that energy go?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Drains to 4th level STS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) Is this a manifestation of the Lizards feeding off of us?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: STSers there retrieve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So, orgasm is a 3rd density manifestation of the 4th density consumption of 3rd density energy?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: One of their methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) In &#34;Bringers of the Dawn&#34; it talks about sex and it says that it is an expression of love and so forth and that you should not have sex with someone who does not really love you.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Love is all that is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) If two individuals, as an expression of true love at higher levels, desire to express this love in a physical way, is it possible to channel the energy in a positive way without feeding the 4th level STS guys?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In other words, no matter what you do, how you think, or whatever, that&#39;s where it goes?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Sex is a physical craving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (V) So, when the big transition comes, let me assume, anybody who is having sex at the time or has any kind of sexual relationships around that time is not going to transition because of that? (L) I don&#39;t think so... (V) Well, I just want to get this clear. Is that true?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. Transition is the &#34;Millennium.&#34; A thousand years is the 3rd level interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, for a thousand years we will be living as physical beings in 4th density... so to speak... making this transition during this period... and, by the time it is over we will have done away with our physical appetites?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close. Some will be there at the beginning, others will need more &#34;time.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) So, when we are on the 4th density, we are still in the physical, and we will still be consuming, will we then be consuming that energy from 3rd density, the orgasmic energy, or something like that?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Some.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Even if we are STO?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not if completely STO.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Then how do we get energy.... we get energy from each other. Which is more powerful... the service... well we have to be service to others... (L) That is because STO multiplies and grows... STS just fragments, segregates, and gets smaller and smaller... (J) The law of diminishing returns. (D) We can access or receive other&#39;s energies as we give our own?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Well, then, that is where Service to Others is Service to Self. (L) Any last messages? I feel a lot of changing going on here. Is there anything for any of us in the way of guidance?
