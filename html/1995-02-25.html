      <p>
        Q: (GB) Can I sit in there now? (T) Sure. Do they want all four of us or just three? {GB takes Terry&#39;s place at the board.}
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) Who do we have with us tonight, we didn&#39;t ask.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who do we have with us tonight?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Who are we?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Who are you?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) And who do we have with us tonight in 3rd density?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Unknown. 3rd density is you! And us in the &#34;past.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Let&#39;s get on with it.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Ask who is at south position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who is at the South position? Oh, that&#39;s you. Yeah, that&#39;s GB, as if you didn&#39;t know. Are we playing bridge, or what?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Hello. Concentrate all in room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (T) What are we going to concentrate on? (L) Is anybody thinking about sex? {laughter}
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (GB) Ask TM&#39;s question: will there be a mass landing in 1995?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not ready to answer. Still trying to settle energy waves in room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (GB) Let me ask you Frank, you are the only one this comes through? (J) Well, we have not really determined that. (F) No, we haven&#39;t determined exactly what happens. It seems like I&#39;m the, what you would call, primary channel. (TM) Can you do it by yourself without anybody else? (F) If I did do it by myself without anybody else holding it, I wouldn&#39;t trust the information. (TM) Can you do it in a meditative state? (F) Well, we have tried it with me under hypnosis and have gotten a lot of information, but again, we don&#39;t trust it because it doesn&#39;t have the participatory aspect to it. (L) This way no one really knows what is being said. It is not coming through any one person&#39;s mind. No one thinks the thoughts as they come through. (F) I have also sat at the computer and gotten a lot of stuff, but, again, I don&#39;t know how much I would trust that. (L) You never can tell how much of that is your own stuff. (F) The standard way of channeling that so many people do, has an extremely questionable validity rating. The validity level of this is also somewhat questionable, but, we have done a lot of checking and testing and, so far, it has more than satisfied all the tests we have applied. (GB) Can we do it with our eyes closed. {An experiment is attempted to see if the information will come through with all eyes closed. It is unsuccessful. Trying various combinations of eyes closed and/or open are also unsuccessful. It seems that the eyes of all participants must be open at once in order for the contact to be sustained. This agrees with the idea that it is a purely telepathic contact and not 3rd density or &#34;poltergeist&#34; in nature.} (L) Now, we are curious as to this channeling process, and ordinarily, when we do not have so many guests, it is quite different, and we want to know who is the primary channel here?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is not the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it important for us to use our senses, as in our eyes, ears and so forth, while doing this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Of course. How else can we see the board?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) They have to see the board through our eyes. (L) Could Frank do this alone?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (F) Could Laura do this alone? (T) Do you want the original three on the board?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. Not issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) Well, what is the issue? (T) What is the problem here?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Fractured frequency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) Why is it fractured?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Detached energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Are you saying that there is something floating around in this room doing this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not certain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) What can we do to help?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Will clear eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (BP) Well, ask a question. Maybe it will clear with a question. (L) Well let me make a suggestion... Terry, you come back and sit down. GB you back up for just a little while and let&#39;s get the flow going with what they are used to and then others can cut in, so to speak. I mean, I am impatient with this method to begin with, even though I find it eminently trustworthy, and this dragging it out is getting on my nerves. (BP) Yeah, my brother-in-law pissed them off! {Changes are made.} (J) I think part of it is that we have new people present in the room and it is a great influx of new energy. (L) Now, how are we feeling?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Now, more powder. We are sorry for the delays. One in the room is under great stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who is stressed?

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Under pressure for study.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (BP) It&#39;s for that article you want to write. (CD) Maybe. (L) Do you have a deadline or something? (CD) Yes. But I am really not thinking about it, at least consciously.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes. You have been watched, CD.
      </p>

      <p>
        Q: (BP) It&#39;s been nice knowing you! {laughter} (GB) Do these guys have a sense of humor? (J) Yes, as a matter of fact, they do! (T) Is this mirth, here?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No, this is not mirth.
      </p>
      <p>

        Q: (L) I will give you an example. We did a session for Barry and Susy Konicov and they were given a very serious warning to back off on certain activities relating to teaching people how to not pay income tax. They called us one night recently because several people they had been associated with had been raided by the IRS. The IRS had confiscated computers, jewelry, equipment, and whatever else they could lay their hands on and were basically holding these people&#39;s possessions hostage until they could determine whether or not what they were doing was illegal or whatever. Barry and Susy expected to be raided imminently. The Cassiopaens said to them that whether or not they got raided was not the point, because they had been warned. The point was, what are you going to do now? What steps are you going to take and what information are you going to accept to prevent further attack? (CD) Should I stop publishing the book?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (J) They will not tell you what to do. (CD) Will not publishing the book stop the harassment and danger?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Open. MUFON has &#34;spies.&#34;

      <p>
        Q: (GB) So what else is new? (BP) Cannot unconditional love and faith overcome all of this?

      <p class="answer">
        A: Open. More is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (GB) Will the government relax their policy this year and release more information to the public?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Complicated question because you are making simple judgments based upon available evidence which can be interpreted a number of different ways, not just one! {I believe this answer is for BP&#39;s question about unconditional love, not GB&#39;s inserted question on another subject.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (TM) In a book I have been reading it specifically states that Stanton Freidman is a spy. (BP) Really? (T) That is what Bill Cooper says? (TM) I may be taking it out of context because I have not read the whole book. (T) I have heard that before. (L) Let&#39;s ask that question. Why do they need spies. Why would anyone need spies in MUFON since everything in MUFON is public?

      <p>
        Q: (GB) Is BP in Danger?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Well, these are simplistic questions, you need more exposure to this and other sources! We know you are skeptical, but that is good for balance, also, you have much material knowledge! There is more to the phenomenon than &#34;meets the eye.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (GB) What is the danger? Is it mental, physical...
      </p>

        Q: (CD) He&#39;s the spy! {Laughter} (BP) He used to work for NASA! (F) Did you really work for the Apollo program? (GB) Oh yeah. Secret, as a consultant. (Laura and Jan) Ah hah! (BP) Could they offer general suggestions... I know they won&#39;t tell us what to do, but this is a general question for all who are anchoring light, who want to be of service, can they offer any specific suggestions for us...

        Q: (L) We are moving into 4th density. (BP) We are not going to skip 4th density and move directly into 5th? (L) 5th is the contemplation zone. (F) Where your soul goes when you die. (L) We are going into a state of variability of physicality. (BP) I read the pamphlet... (L) Well, that is just highlights. There is over 300 pages of material. (J) We are working on getting it together. (L) They have talked about the fact that we are moving into a 4th density state and the reptilian beings are trying like heck to prevent this because, once we are in that situation, if there are enough of us who are in the STO mode...

        A: You are all 4th density candidates.

        Q: (L) Once we move into 4th density we are on an equal footing with all these other guys and things will be more equal. At the same time, those who are not 4th density candidates are going to cycle back and start all over again. Basically they are all going to go into the primordial soup and experience another 300,000 years of strife and misery. (BP) And this moving into 4th density will be a change in perception, rather than a change in location, in terms of space/time, is that correct? (L) Um hmm.

        A: That is not the issue. We choose STO.

      <p>
        Q: (L) STO beings do not exert power over anyone, they only serve all. When STS beings call for knowledge and have raised their frequency levels, which can be done while still remaining STS, the only place in the universe they will obtain knowledge is from STO beings, even though they may use this knowledge to serve themselves. STS beings won&#39;t GIVE knowledge, because that is STO. (GB) Do the Lizzies have souls?

        A: You are an STO Candidate.

      <p>
        Q: (J) You are already on the path, so don&#39;t worry about. (L) Terry had the idea that we should use their implants against them and blow their circuits. We were told that the thing to do is to simply not manifest the thoughts and feelings they like. This has happened to a peripheral person here. She was supposed to be at the meeting today but she called and left a message saying that she had gotten a psychic message that she was not to go and meet us there. I called her when I got home and told her what a great meeting she had missed. She called me back ten minutes later telling me I had a lot of nerve putting her down and trampling all over her feelings. I was quite taken aback. The Lizzies are really working on her hard and are making her emotionally unstable, and making her receive everything positive in a negative way. As long as you KNOW that they are going to play with your head and your emotions, if you know that this is not YOU, but head games from outside, then you don&#39;t have to own it. It isn&#39;t yours. We don&#39;t have to buy into these negative perceptions. (F) Part of the disinformation tells us that we are totally in control of our own ship, our own minds, everything that happens to us, create your own reality and so forth. So, when negative things happen or we think negative thoughts, we either believe them or think that we are trying to destroy our own selves. (GB) Are all in this room 4th density STO Candidates?

        A: Exactly!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who is M__ H__? (BP) Damn! I took a trip with Reynaldo T___, I met M__ there and we were thrown together in an obvious sort of Celestine Prophecy sort of way, you know, like hit me over the head. And we did this thing at the sacrificial well in Chichen Itza that was apparently some kind of cleansing, because, according to the archaeological inaccuracies, that is where the people were all sacrificed. Maybe they weren&#39;t sacrificed, maybe they were volunteers. (L) Maybe it was a different culture altogether. (BP) Yes, because we don&#39;t know who all was there. The Mayans may have been long gone. Anyway, we did some sort of healing there and afterward M__ told me a lot of stuff about who she was: on January 11, 1991 she was an ordinary person, she was driving down the road in her car and she felt a presence in her car that turned out to be Jesus Christ. She was taken out of her body, her life was reviewed for her, she was taken to 5th density, which she says is what we know as heaven, and after about 20 minutes or so, she returned as, apparently, someone else. She became very psychic and started having all these experiences. Classic walk-in story. Among other things she says now her body is silicone based and that she is here to anchor a certain energy. My feeling was that, well, I was bouncing back and forth between feeling that this was a demented housewife or an f______ angel walking on the planet. That was my reaction. I sort of fell in love with her except that I wasn&#39;t physically attracted to her. She did some work on me. I didn&#39;t feel a thing. We spent 6 days in each other&#39;s company. So, I have been rather curious. And then, Caryl just sort of blew up in the middle of it. And it was so obvious to me that I had to follow my spirit in that direction and that was what I was supposed to do. It didn&#39;t feel like STS, but who knows? M__ reacted extremely negatively. We had not consummated the relationship. She is still living with her husband who won&#39;t touch her, who thinks she is crazy, he is total 3rd density. She hadn&#39;t been able to get out of that situation. She is way into some weird stuff. (L) Well, M__ may be pure STO, but she may not be fully manifested in the body. (BP) Yeah, she says she is having a lot of trouble anchoring here. (L) My thought is that a lot of us are actually 4th density beings who have come back down to serve. (BP) We are all multi-dimensional masters playing at limitation. (BP) Who is Reynaldo T___?
