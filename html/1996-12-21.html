        Q: (L) The first question on my mind before we get to any of these other questions is: who is giving information to Sheldon Nidle about the photon belt and the mass landings that are supposed to take place on the 31st of December and the 1st of January?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) It is just coming out of his own head? He is not seeing any beings or channeling anything?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I would like to ask about this fellow Jim, in a somewhat indirect way. This is a person who corresponds with Ark on a variety of subjects {and claims to have inside connections to deep government ops}. This last question that he was asked was: (reading) &#34;Do you know about any possible relation between deep space travel and DNA structure? Or between crop circles coding and CNA coding? Have you ever been told or shown something about DNA? Like relation between time rate and the structure of our genes?&#34; And, here is what Jim replied: &#34;Yes, but I have been warned not to discuss this matter where it is open to unknown ears.&#34; Could you comment on that?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: The best thing for Ark to do is request &#34;closed&#34; correspondence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this guy have some knowledge about DNA or crop circles?

        Q: (A) So, all the problems that I had as a child were the result of this?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) Let me ask this: all of the experiences that I had as a child were caused by this emotion where I was trying to punish myself. I have spent my lifetime trying to punish myself. Is that right?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close. But remember, the point is, you sought out a environment that you perceived to be restrictive and unforgiving. Especially with your father.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Was there other karma with her father in this lifetime?

        Q: (L) Now, time to stop messing around. You said that &#34;prime numbers are the &#39;dwelling places&#39; of the mystics.&#34; I have been poring over this material and it occurs to me that this was put in quotes for a reason, yes?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We put in quotes what we want further examined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I was thinking that this could be a clue on several levels. Could it be a clue to identify people and interactions?

      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And, also as a means of decoding coded written material?

      <p class="answer">
        A: Sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Would this written material be some that is channeled? Or, more formal and general writings of mystics. Could it be, in other words, that they might write in a casual way and not be aware that they are channeling or writing in code?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I dug around about the Templars and have, more or less, come to the conclusion that they were just a smoke screen, and that something else was going on at the time that WAS important. I also think that they have been resurrected from time to time and dusted off and blamed for all this secret knowledge that is supposedly lost... am I on to something here?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.
      </p>

      <p class="answer">
        A: Good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I will. I wanted to get to this other subject anyway. We know that you have said that time is an illusion in 3rd density reality - that it is the 3rd density illusion - and it is involved with our DNA, which determines how we perceive it. So, it is an illusion. Yet, somehow, this illusion converts at some point into a solid reality via some mode or operation. I would like to know, at what point it converts and how?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are off base. Who said it converts?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, we perceive a damn solid reality! There is STUFF that if you kick it, it hurts!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That perception is part of the illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) But, that is obviously not the TOTAL illusion. What else is a part of this illusion? If our perception is part, then there must also be something there to be perceived, correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, what is it that we are perceiving?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That which you are programmed to perceive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is not this perception, these things we perceive as outside ourselves, are they not substance of some sort? Are they not there in some form, even if we perceive them the way we do?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Of course, but what does this have to do with &#34;time?&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I am getting to that! We perceive a world &#34;out there.&#34; Trees, cars, trucks, houses, bricks, boards, blocks, people, dogs etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You left out backyard barbecues!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: [laughter] (L) Very funny! We perceive things out there. Of what are they composed?

        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What is the difference between her thoughts and my thoughts?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is what binds you. You see, it is merely a program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it merely a program that we think we are separate individuals?
      </p>

        A: Not the point.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In my computer? Different places. I get them and load them in. Are programs made - do they exist like &#39;thought centers&#39; - and do we just load them in ourselves?
      </p>

        A: Why have you forgotten? 309,000...
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Oh. You are talking about the &#34;takeover&#34; by 4th density STS. But, still, the point I am trying to get to is - yes we have DNA - but you can&#39;t reprogram DNA if there is not DNA there to begin with. If there is not something to load the program into. What is the substance of this reality that we exist in?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You just answered.

        Note: Cannapolis, now Kannapolis. Early published name variations include Cannon-opolis and Cannapolis. A widely accepted origin of the word Kannapolis comes from the combination of the Greek words &#34;kanna&#34; (reeds, not looms) and &#34;polis&#34; (city), which some believed meant &#34;City of Looms&#34;.
