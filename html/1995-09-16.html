        Q: (L) Hello.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who do we have with us?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) We have a guest this evening. And we have a few questions that I want to ask before we get launched off into some other subjects. First thing is, I had a pretty sick feeling in response to this whole situation with Martie T__, and I did cancel the talk at the book store she is associated with. I know you are not going to tell me whether I did the right thing or the wrong thing, however, I would like to know if there are any implications regarding this situation that I do not, at present, see?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Implications?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, in other words, was there someone who would have been there that I should have made a connection with? Did I fail by not going through with it even though it was so distasteful to me?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If distasteful, how would you fail by not appearing?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, sometimes I wonder if we are not supposed to overcome our emotional reactions to things and just do things that are emotionally distasteful in spite of our own feelings. Isn&#39;t that correct?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are aware of the nature of your instincts. The nature of...
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What are you trying to tell me here? Am I being dense?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: What are you always telling others?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Listen to your instincts. Yes. And my instincts told me that this was not a good place to go nor a good group to have any involvement with.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Have you not then answered your own question?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay. Last night Terry called me and said that on Wednesday night he began channeling the Cassiopaean&#39;s directly in his [Buddhist] meditation class. The way he described his experience almost sounded like a physical possession. Can you come through with physical sensations? Was Terry channeling YOU, the Cassiopaeans or a similar source?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We must have been watching a different &#34;channel!&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who was being channeled?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Ask Terry!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, he said he was channeling YOU!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Ask him after a few more sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there some danger that can be experienced if one goes to a class and the meditation teacher instructs everyone to stare into a mirror and channel the first thing that comes along?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Maybe, but there is some danger in all things at 3rd density.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (RC) You need to find out who he was tapping into. Was it his higher self?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Roxanne has some questions... okay?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (RC) By scanning the Zohar, does this mean that the fire letters will ignite ancient memory, thus bringing the truth to the surface?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: These are &#34;cult thought patterns.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (RC) It has come to my attention that most of the places where the word for &#34;God&#34; is used in Zohar as well as in the Old Testament, it is used in its feminine form. Does this imply that the Queen of Heaven... who is Isis?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

        A: Neither, Jesus is moniker only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (RC) What is moniker? What do you mean? Don&#39;t you have to pray in the name of Jesus for protection?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Prayers are not necessary for protection once channel, or more appropriately, conduit is properly grooved!

      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: &#34;Heaven&#34; is a concept more than semantics. Some think the 3rd density environment known popularly as Leavenworth is heaven, for one example. Could be called &#34;Heavenworth!&#34;

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) This was a lesson, obviously. I guess it is not appropriate for me to ask any personal questions about him. Maybe it would be okay for you since you were personally involved. (RC) Is Barry a spy?

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: My Dear, you seem to be stuck upon gender classifications. Now this is understandable, but prepare yourself for a long winded explanation here, since there appears to be no other way. On density levels 5 through 7 there is no duality. The &#34;God Force&#34; emanates &#34;down&#34; from 7th density and permeates all densities. It recognizes no classifications related to duality, since it is perfectly blended, thus in permanent balance.
