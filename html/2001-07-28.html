        This was our first sitting with just the two of us. We sat for a minute or two. The planchette began to circle slowly, and then spelled out:
      </p>
      <p>
        Pulsation Pattern Pygmies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reminded Ark of a dream he had had a couple of nights previously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Okay, now when you refer to these pulsation pattern pygmies, are you referring to the dwarf clowns in Ark&#39;s dream the other night?
