      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) They seem to be so smart with their god behind them, and they did such a big thing, only to make a mistake. (L) I guess we can only wait to see how it turns out. It&#39;s a spooky idea. What do countries do when something like that is discovered and they have had a long-term diplomatic relationship? They talk to each other, they pat each other on the back. What do they do? It&#39;s like having to get a divorce when everybody thought you had such a happy marriage. And when it&#39;s like this? It&#39;s like having to get a divorce after discovering that your partner has murdered your children and buried them in the back yard. (A) Yeah, but it&#39;s not so clear, because when you say &#34;Israel,&#34; it&#39;s not one thing. There are different parties, different factions, they are fighting. We don&#39;t know.

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: To suppress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, that&#39;s the damnedest thing I ever heard. Did the U.S. Government shoot down the fourth plane as some people are suggesting?
      </p>

        A: Yes.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) What is the most probable scenario. There were infiltrators, they had some knowledge, and they communicated this knowledge to some part of Intelligence, but this part of Intelligence did not press to communicate it to the higher parties?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes. And it was not known plan.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Well, I&#39;m saying stuff in there that&#39;s needed to be said for a long time. Are we going to survive until we get it printed?

        A: Sitting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (A) Fourteen hours a day, non-stop, both of us. (L) I guess if we took one hour a day to do exercise... Anything else that we need to be aware of... (A) On our website, we have entered a kind of political stream which attracts attention. Going into this is natural and automatic. But there may be other not-so-natural things that may not come to our minds. Anything additional we need to cover?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        Q: Well, Sollog did predict that this would happen in 1997. But then, then, the guy on the newsgroup predicted that something was going to happen in seven days... That was bizarre. He didn&#39;t say what, but the message was headed with 9/11. If he had known what was going to happen, I think he would have at least hinted. (A) But that would be too dangerous for him.
      </p>
