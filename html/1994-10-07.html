        1 The asteroid belt is a doughnut-shaped concentration of asteroids orbiting the Sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, closer to the orbit of Mars. The asteroids have a slightly elliptical orbit. The time for one revolution around the Sun varies from about three to six Earth years. The strong gravitational force of the planet Jupiter shepherds the asteroid belt, pulling the asteroids away from the Sun, keeping them from careening into the inner planets. The asteroid belt may be material that never coalesced into a planet, perhaps because its mass was too small; the total mass of all the asteroids is only a small fraction of that of our Moon. Whether or not the asteroid belt is the remains of a planet that was destroyed cannot be definitely affirmed or denied. After reading a number of books and papers on the subject, one finds that those who say &#34;impossible&#34; don&#39;t have much to back them up, and those who think that it might be possible can&#39;t prove anything either. Those who think it was a planet suppose that it might have been fragmented by an impact by a large comet.

        2 Al Bielek is, apparently, a convincing speaker in the eyes of some people. He presents a wide range of popular references during his talks and weaves quite a tale in the telling. However, the information available prior to the 1983 movie, &#34;The Philadelphia Experiment&#34; did not concern the prospect of time transport. The stated focus of the &#34;Philadelphia Experiment&#34; project was to &#34;achieve radar invisibility&#34;. Mr. Bielek states that his &#34;memories began coming back AFTER seeing the movie in 1988.&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people get the impression that he incorporates new topics into his storyline as fast as he hears them, claiming that his &#34;memory suddenly came back on that.&#34; One major flaw in his story is the statement that Nikola Tesla was in association with and in charge of the Philadelphia project. This is highly incredible since the experiment supposedly occurred in July, 1943 and Tesla died on January 7, 1943 in New York City. Dr. Von Neumann (of computer fame) was supposedly involved in the &#34;Philadelphia Experiment&#34; with Tesla, Einstein and LeBon. Bielek says he is recorded to have died in 1953 or 1957.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Phoenix, 1986, Bielek&#39;s memories recalled a site in Montauk which, according to Bielek, &#34;might be where Von Neumann currently resides in obscurity&#34;. Another major discrepancy, records indicate the original manned experiment occurred on October 28, 1943, NOT the 12th of August, 1943. Despite the irregularities, there were some interesting comments made in regard to time. The two most outstanding things about the public lecture was the showing of a slide purported to be a &#34;Zero Time Reference Generator&#34; which looks strangely similar to an old Army field kitchen refrigeration unit, according to Chuck Henderson&#39;s military experience. No technical details were given or offered. This device was purported to be the oscillator which drove the coils of the experiment. Mr. Bielek claimed that the unit shown was used to synchronize two separate signals (one for each coil).
      </p>
      <p>
        The literature of the &#34;Philadelphia Experiment&#34; is replete with descriptions of the technology. If you get the chance to hear Mr. Bielek, it is highly recommended if only for entertainment. However, if you want usable data, good luck!

        4 Pay particular note to this remark above. It was my sensation that &#34;Candy&#34; was a corrupting influence in her participation and focus on personal issues, and here we have the C&#39;s confirming this. Keeping the connection clean has been an ongoing problem. Very often, the presence of a person with extremely negative, low or even aggressive attitude can &#34;skew&#34; the reception. But even in such cases, we are often able to retrieve the Cassiopaean intent by careful study.

        5 The reader will notice that I often ask the same questions over again, sometimes in a different way, and sometimes not. This was my way of &#34;testing&#34; the source in terms of consistency over time.

        6 This is an important point because it signifies that even if a person is deceived while in the body, the true frequency of that individual, and their intent to be of Service to Others means a lot.
