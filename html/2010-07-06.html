      As you can see, this is a test, or grooving session. It turned out so well that I decided to publish it. We&#39;ll see in time how accurate it is with a different combination of sitters.
      <p>
        Session Date: July 6th 2010

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) This is July 6, 2010. Just playing.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Hello children of Cassiopaea Olreila here!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well hello. I guess we&#39;ll be grooving another channel here.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes &#39;Andromeda&#39; has the gift!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Andromeda) Making me blush! [laughter]
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Help for humanity is not needed blushing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I guess you&#39;ll get your syntax sorted out soon enough.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Grooving takes a little time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do we have any questions we want to ask while we&#39;re playing around here? Is there going to be a gigantic methane eruption in the Gulf of Mexico resulting in a tsunami that wipes out everybody in Florida?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No. The methane is a serious contributor to global &#34;warming&#34;, however.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is oil leaking out of the ocean bed floor in the Gulf of Mexico in any other places besides through the well?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes but that is happening elsewhere as well. All part of the &#34;opening up&#34; phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, you mean that what we&#39;ve speculated about sinkholes and cracks in the earth... What is causing this opening up?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Misalignment, or rather sliding of layers of crust of earth due to slowing of rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, what is causing this slowing of rotation?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We have mentioned the approach of companion star and its tendency to &#34;ground&#34; the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Anybody got any questions? (Atriedes) I just wanted to ask about what we were talking about the other day. Is there some grand plan with BP and these corporations, or are they just being so self-centered that they&#39;re causing all this havoc? (L repeating for the tape) Okay, the question is is there a grand plan of the BP people and the various individuals who are screwing things up? I mean, are they planning some kind of ultimate objective?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Your assessment is correct, it is the natural chaos that follows psychopathy wherever it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Andromeda) Can I ask about Yellowstone? Is any of this &#34;movement&#34; is going to wake it up and cause a major eruption soon? Or is that too predictiony?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is more likely than a cataclysmic ocean floor explosion of methane.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, so in the next 5 years, what is the percentage of probability of the supervolcano at Yellowstone going off?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: 58%
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) 58, is that it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) 58 percent. Well, that&#39;s more than half, but still kind of 50/50 in the next five years. (Ailén) There was a question we talked about today about what would happen in the southern hemisphere... (L) Yes. So, if there was a global superstorm like in the movie we watched today [The Day After Tomorrow], what goes on in the southern hemisphere during such an event? The movie only showed storms in the Northern Hemisphere.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Less violent storms but storms nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What about an ice age?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Ice ages grip the south somewhat, but the greatest damage is via drought, floods, and earthquakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay. Well, obviously this thing going on in the Gulf of Mexico is nevertheless a dangerous thing. Is the oil going to have an effect on the thermohaline current that keeps ice ages at bay?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Oh certainly! It may take a year or two for the damage to be felt catastrophically but for now the greatest danger is in the rain and general toxicity of the adjacent areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it advisable for people to move away?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If possible, but if they cannot, they must take care to avoid the toxicity and detox what they cannot avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Andromeda) Are we gonna get some of the toxicity on the wind over here in Europe?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Andromeda) Are we already getting some of that?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Very slight. Wait three months.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What&#39;s going to happen in three months?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: The Gulf Stream will have carried the oil to the North Atlantic from where Europe gets most of its rain and storms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, swell!!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: It will be significantly diluted by then but noticeable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Belibaste) If the crust is opening up and there are multiple leaks, I guess humans can&#39;t stop the leaks, and they only stop when the oil pressure equals the ocean pressure. (L) It could go on for years!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Belibaste) How long is it going to take?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: 8 years if nothing intervenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is something expected to intervene?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Oh, that would be telling!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Perceval) Are they seriously considering using a nuke?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Andromeda) Oh no... (Perceval) So that&#39;s what could intervene to stop it?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not what we were referring to. A nuke under the present cosmic conditions will only make it worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So you say &#34;that would be telling&#34;, yet you have told us that somewhere maybe in June or July of 2014 will be Year 0 of a new era. So, are we to assume that something is going to intervene that will stop the leak and sort things out on this planet?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Oh indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Umm... Is this something that we&#39;re going to consider to be beneficial? {laughter}
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: It&#39;s like having a baby: blood, water, pain, but joy when it is over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Andromeda) How long will it take to be over? (Burma Jones) Yeah, how long is the labor? (L) Some people die in childbirth, ya know!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Not if they are utilizing knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay. (Burma Jones) What was it that was causing so much pain on everyone&#39;s right side here lately?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Planetary linkage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (Andromeda) I&#39;m so swollen today, and Ailén&#39;s swollen. &#34;Crazy like cockroaches&#34;, like I said. (Belibaste) &#34;Planetary linkage&#34; is because the planet is suffering, so we are suffering?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: More or less.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, swell! (Ailén) Does that mean it&#39;s going to get worse then?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: It can and probably will. Knowledge protects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So we have to be really careful about our diet, taking our supplements, and looking after ourselves in order to get through it. I mean, we have to take care of ourselves as we wish the planet to be cared for?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Anything else? I think our experiment is successful. Anything that we should have asked, that we didn&#39;t ask, consider it asked, and give us the answer! {laughter}
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Just keep your eyes open. Goodbye.
