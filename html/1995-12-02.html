        Frank, Laura
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Hello, is anyone there? Do you still love us?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Silly Billy!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, sometimes one needs a little reassurance! Who do we have with us tonight?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Rommolah Cassiopaea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) As you know, T&amp;J were here last night and I felt a lot of very strange sensations, as though there was something very dark that came in with them. My stomach was actually hurting. What is going on?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Specifics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is there some negative energy there?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Is chided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What does that mean?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: As your learning center library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, the dictionary says: to scold, to reprove mildly. Who is scolding him?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: These are the circumstances unfolding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) The circumstances unfolding are going to chide him or are in the act of chiding him?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: The latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I sort of felt an energy that was NOT him, but that was following him and came in with him. I even thought I heard it say: &#34;He&#39;s ours!&#34;
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: If attached, it is a &#34;fluid&#34; situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, they were both talking about plans to start another channeling group with Andrew B__ and then another still after they move away, because they are now talking about moving to Tallahassee. So, obviously they do not now, nor does it seem that they ever had, any intentions of being permanent group members. Or did I misunderstand?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I am sorry that they feel this way. I have essentially prepared all my life to do this, and so has Frank. They have helped a lot.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Group would have too many chiefs and not enough indians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Now, this situation going on with Roxanne has made me think that I ought to decline editing her magazine. Any comment?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Beware not to misread. Roxanne is strongly influenced in her behavior by biological cycles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, I should just let it pass?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, I thought the magazine was a good idea...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Let the &#34;flow&#34; guide you in decisions regarding your actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) That is pretty much what I try to do. Well, if Roxanne is being influenced by biology, and Terry is being chided, what is happening to me? I mean, I get dumped on by one, and then less than 12 hours later I get dumped on by the other, and then my husband dumps on me on top of all of it and it is just more than I can handle.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Suggest ventilation of room. Ionizing factors level balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) [Open windows] Do the ionizing factors have anything to do with the people who have been in this room in the past few days?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: All connects. You may close the windows later for comfort after balance is restored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) When we did the session on October 21st, we were talking about robotoid type people, or reanimated humans, and that this is what is done rather than cloning and replacing. Then you said I had been in contact with 7 of these, and we identified one of them. Then, we talked about profiles, and it was indicated that a &#34;bland&#34; personality might have something to do with identification. You also said that you could not identify the others right at that moment. Can you now do so?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Search your &#34;files.&#34; Learning is sometimes best accomplished by study and exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Can I have a couple more clues as to what I am looking for? You mentioned being in a hospital...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Non-emotive. There are other clues which you can discover by your own study. It would not be advantageous for us to give you further information on this subject. Speculation about this particular subject will throw you off track.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is the subject as important as I think it might be?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Ultimately, but not yet!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I did an interview that was taped and broadcast on a local television station. I am curious as to whether that will lead to any further similar activity?

        A: Like a pot on rising boil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Let&#39;s get off the personal things and onto interesting things.

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Speaking of that, Roxanne wants to move to Sedona, and she says that one of reasons she wants to do this is because &#34;Florida is low density,&#34; in her opinion, and &#34;Lizzieland,&#34; and full of negative entities and energies. Is this an accurate assessment?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: All could always be better, but judgments made in haste as an emotional reaction to events, and generalized in nature, are bound to be rife with emotionally induced prejudice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this mean that it is possible that she is jumping out of the frying pan into the fire by moving off to &#34;alien-land&#34; out there in the Southwest?

      <p class="answer">
        A: Of course! As you well know!
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I feel sorry that she feels this way, and that she is possibly putting herself into danger because she does not seem to be thinking clearly right now, and there does not seem to be anything I can do or say. She is just adamant that Florida is a horrible place because of what happened to her here. In a way, I feel insulted.
      </p>

        Chordates form a phylum of creatures that are based on a bilateral body plan, and is defined by having at some stage in their lives all of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        A notochord, in other words a fairly stiff rod of cartilage that extends along the inside of the body. Among the vertebrate sub-group of chordates the notochord develops into the spine, and in wholly aquatic species this helps the animal to swim by flexing its tail.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dorsal neural tube. In fish and other vertebrates this develops into the spinal cord, the main communications trunk of the nervous system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pharyngeal slits. The pharynx is the part of the throat immediately behind the mouth. In fish the slits are modified to form gills, but  in some other chordates they are part of a filter-feeding system that extracts particles of food from the water in which the animals live.
      </p>
      <p>
        Post-anal tail. A muscular tail that extends backwards behind the anus.
      </p>
      <p>
        An endostyle. This is a groove in the ventral wall of the pharynx. In filter-feeding species it produces mucus to gather food particles, which helps in transporting food to the esophagus.  It also stores iodine, and may be a precursor of the vertebrate thyroid gland.
