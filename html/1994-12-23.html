      </p>

        A: No ritual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (F) Did somebody do a ritual? (L) No. Did you do one in your mind, DM? (D) I just rubbed my hands together. (L) No, I don&#39;t think that is what they are talking about. It&#39;s because we were talking about rituals and why we don&#39;t do them. Okay, why did you tell us &#34;no ritual?&#34;
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: DM. Caution.
      </p>
      <p>

        Q: Are you a discarnate?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No, Cassiopaean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Let me ask you about your spelling of the word &#34;Cassiopaea.&#34; It is the archaic spelling of Cassiopia, but not the one currently used. However, the last part of the word, as you spell it, is the word Paean, which is a &#34;warning&#34; sound or an announcement or message. Something that calls people to attention. Is there any chosen symbology in your use of this spelling.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: No, but nice analogy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) I want to thank you very much for the advice you gave me. It was something that was very much on my mind and your advice probably saved my daughter from running away.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: You are welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) I want to impose on you, and I hope you don&#39;t mind. S__&#39;s father has influence on her; is he someone I need to warn her about? {Asking about her daughter}

      <p class="answer">
        A: Worry not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does that mean that the less DM says, the sooner S__ will figure things out for herself?

        A: Your use is your pathway of learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) My pathway... I am not understanding... (L) In other words, they may not specifically have a use for you in the sense of being used, but your pathway of learning is what you are here doing. (D) I am supposed to be learning and I&#39;m supposed to stay here until I learn?
      </p>

        A: Yes. Everyone is always learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Why do you say she is not leaving. That is a pretty definite statement and you guys don&#39;t usually make real definite statements like that?
      </p>

      </p>

I have been eating bananas. (L) Well, we were talking earlier about all the synchronous events that happened during the year prior to the beginning of this contact, and I would like to know if those events were, in part, engineered by you guys?

      <p>
        Q: (D) That means yes. (L) In the forming of this conduit, is the conduit not only something that brings energy into us, but also through which we can travel into other dimensions as well? Does it go both ways?

        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) So, what if we had a lot of people do that? (L) They told us that this was similar to what they did at Stonehenge, that walking a pattern like a maze design would concentrate energy. A spiral. (Planchette demonstrates by moving in a gradually expanding spiral which then gradually got smaller.) Are you demonstrating the pattern that should be used?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Cycle.

      </p>
      <p>

She saw things that she didn&#39;t get when she was a kid and I explained to her that now she wasn&#39;t a kid and she couldn&#39;t really enjoy those things but she could enjoy the things that would be more her age level.

        Q: (L) Oh, good, that&#39;s clever! I never thought about that. Okay, that&#39;s how I&#39;ll find out. It&#39;s too simple. I&#39;m beginning to feel brain dead. Why have my eyes been bothering me so much for the last year?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Eyes do that on 3rd density.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) I have been having similar problems. (F) I have been getting near-sighted in the last year. (L) Anybody got any questions? (D) Not me, I just had a huge, huge problem solved in just a few words... what else could I want to know? But, there is something... DM N__, how does he fit in my life?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Is he a good guy? (L) They are not going to tell you that.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I guess it depends on your point of view. I&#39;m sure Hitler thought he was a good man. That is subjective. Good and evil are subjective. (D) Would he and I be compatible?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Discover on your own. Free will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, there is a way you might be able to find out something. Since all minds are one mind, the Cassiopaeans don&#39;t mind telling you what another person thinks or how they think. What does DM N__ think of DM?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Jumbled thought patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is this DM N__ that DM has met, is he the same David Navarra that Sally B. was acquainted with in St. Petersburg?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: How many are there with that name?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, there are probably more than one, but I don&#39;t think all of them in this area would be involved in the metaphysical community. That would narrow it down. Was Sally B. accurately reading the situation when she said that the DM N__ she knew was a little hung up on sex?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Many are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Okay, what are David N_&#39;s intentions toward DM?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Would he like to get me in bed?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We might ask the same question of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What are your intentions? (D) I don&#39;t have any intentions until I find out whether or not he has good intentions. I am not going to jump in the hay with anybody unless I find out that they really care for me. So, that is why I am asking.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) I don&#39;t think they are going to help you out on this one. The closest we are going to get is that he has jumbled thoughts and he is probably the same guy Sally knew.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: The &#34;bedroom&#34; is not our specialty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Not mine either, fortunately or unfortunately. (L) Well, let&#39;s ask about J__ R__, has he read the transcripts all or in part, and, if so, what is his reaction?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Dreamy person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) What do you mean by dreamy? He dreams a lot?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Self explanatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: So, &#34;dreamy person&#34; is his reaction to the transcripts?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Dreamy person is he.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Does this mean that he lives in the world of dreams and not reality? (D) Or, is he someone who initiates his thoughts in the dream state?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: We are merely relating our observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Has he read the transcripts?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Some.

      <p>
        Q: (L) What did he think in reaction to them?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Oh, he was reading it and it hit something? (L) Is that it, what DM is saying?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Well, it hit something and he went off into a dream. So, it hit some of his reality. (D) I want to ask some questions about M__: will she and Eddie Page reestablish communication? (L) I didn&#39;t know they were on the outs. But, I don&#39;t know either of them well enough to ask questions. (D) Well, apparently the story is that M__ told someone else that Eddie was having affairs with other women and it got back to E__.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: People have shortcomings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Will they get back together?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Did M__ relay a falsehood about Eddie? (D) Eddie said she did, anyway.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) She said that Eddie had mistresses.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is not important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (D) Well, that is okay. (L) On the day that we saw Eddie, I guess it was last Saturday, he told us that he had been abducted three days before. Was this a physical abduction or was it a Virtual Reality abduction?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: It was the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Of the many abductions he claims to have experienced, how many are of the VR type?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Half or thereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) In a Virtual Reality Abduction, does any part of the person actually leave and go into another dimension?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Soul replication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, a replica of their soul, like a shadow of the soul, so to speak, like maybe a holographic part of the soul gets moved into another dimension and experiences events; is that what you mean?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) So, when a person experiences a Virtual Reality Abduction it&#39;s virtually real in the sense that it happens to them on some level, or to some part of them?
      </p>

        A: It is real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) But, their physical body is not being abducted and going anywhere?

      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, that&#39;s intriguing. (D) Is that like... (L) It said soul replication...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Think of photo copier, similar concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) A photocopy? So, half of Eddie&#39;s abductions are Virtual Reality Abductions...
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: And the other half are actual physical abductions?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Well, he told me they were beautiful. (D) His father is one of them, he says. Beautiful people, the way I see it, means from the heart... not like physical beauty... (L) Does he perceive them as physically beautiful?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        A: That is subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) And, since you say that they rearrange their appearance, in their natural state, before they are rearranged, what do they look like?
