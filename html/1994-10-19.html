        Frank and Laura
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Do we have anybody with us tonight?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: We are always with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Who are we talking with tonight?

      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Is it true that when we ask an individual under hypnosis about an alien abduction scenario to try to tune in to aliens... can we do that?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes. The individual is aware on every level and the information you seek was known at the time. The questions you ask are merely an accessing of information that is already in awareness at some level. Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs are too regimented.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        A: Cream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: (L) Because she backed out on the cream deal? {“Candy” had the idea to make and sell a face cream and had gotten a number of people involved and investing and it flopped.}
